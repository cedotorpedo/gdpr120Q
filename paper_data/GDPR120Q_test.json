Kurfess, Kai Grana\u00df, Max Honig, Dr. Tizian Bonus\nLocal Court of Hamburg (Amtsgericht), HRB 133503\nVAT number: DE296745664\nPrivacy Policy Appinio App\nThe Appinio app is provided by APPINIO GmbH (hereinafter \"we\"). When you are using this app, we may collect, process and use data. Since the protection of your privacy is important to us when using Appinio, we would like to inform you about which of your personal data is collected when you use Appinio and how we handle this data. You can access this data protection declaration at any time at https://link.appinio.com/#/en/privacy\n1. Responsible Person / Contact\nResponsible party in terms of data protection rights:\nAPPINIO GmbH\nGro\u00dfe Theaterstra\u00dfe 31\n20354 Hamburg, Germany\nRepresented by the Managing Directors Jonathan Kurfess, Kai Grana\u00df, Max Honig, Dr. Tizian Bonus\nData Protection Officer:\nePrivacy GmbH\nProf. Dr. Christoph Bauer\nGro\u00dfe Bleichen 21\n20354 Hamburg\nEmail: c.bauer@eprivacy.eu\nIf you have any questions or suggestions regarding data protection, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at hello@appinio.com\n2. data processing, legal basis\n2.1 Data protection subject\nPersonal data is subject to data protection. According to Art. 4 (1) GDPR, this includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, information such as name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number, but may also include usage data. Usage data is data that is required to use our website / app, such as information on the start, end and extent of use of our app and registration data.\n2.2 Types of data processed\nContact details (e.g. e-mail), usage data (e.g. use of app functions, access times), Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), Survey data, Processing of special categories of data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR (where consent has been given)\n2.3 Categories of data subjects involved in the processing\nUsers of the Appinio App. In the following, we will refer to the persons concerned collectively as \"users\".\n2.4 Purpose of processing\nDeployment of the Appinio App, its contents and functions. Fulfilment of our services and implementation of contractual measures as well as response to contact enquiries and communication with users.\n2.5 Applicable legal basis\nIn accordance with Art. 13 GDPR, we hereby inform you of the legal basis of our data processing. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the data protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 GDPR, the legal basis for processing in order to fulfil our services and carry out contractual measures as well as answer inquiries is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, the legal basis for processing in order to fulfil our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, and the legal basis for processing in order to safeguard our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.\n2.6 Collaboration with contract processors and third parties\nInsofar as we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract processors or third parties) within the scope of our processing, transmit them to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of a legal permission (e.g. if a transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR is necessary for the performance of the contract), consent, or a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.). If we commission third parties with the processing of data on the basis of a so-called \"order processing contract\", this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.\n3. Collection and use of your data\n3.1. Registration\nIn order to fully use Appinio, you must create an account. When you register, we collect your email address.\n3.2. Data\nWhen you respond to surveys or short surveys (\"Quickies\"), the following data will be transferred from you to us:\n- A unique identifier for your account (\"User ID\")\n- Your answers\n3.3. Voluntary survey data\nWhen you provide us with data within the scope of surveys, we store this data together with your user account. In this way, we carry out targeted analyses and effective market research for our partner companies. Of course, with each survey you decide for yourself whether you want to participate in the survey and enter certain data. We process the data you enter statistically and pass the analysis on to our partner companies in anonymous form, which does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about individual users. Our partners do not have access to your data in raw form. You can also use the app to answer individual questions that are asked independently of certain surveys, so-called \"quickies\". We will store some of your answers assigned to your account. In this way, we classify your account into certain target group categories, which result from the answers to the quickies. In addition, we publish statistical data on individual quickies in a summarized form - for example, what percentage of participants gave which answer. Conversely, you can also view other users' answers and compare them with your own answers. At no time will your answers be visibly linked to other data in such a way that other users can identify you. Our partner companies have access to the created target group categories, but not to the data of your account. Users of the Appinio App have the possibility to give a declaration of consent, which enables Appinio to provide you with more surveys. For example, you allow the processing of data from \"special categories\" (Art. 9 GDPR), which allows Appinio to display questions about certain topics, such as, for example, politics. Your consent will be treated separately from this Privacy Policy and the Appinio App Terms and Conditions. The consent is voluntary and can be viewed and revoked at any time in the app's settings.\n3.4 Leaderboard, Profile, Creating Questions\nYou can unlock a leaderboard within the app in which you can compare yourself with other users. In the ranking, on your profile in the app and when asking your own questions, you can have a profile picture that is displayed to other users. You can choose an avatar from Appinio, upload a picture from your phone or take a picture with your phone and use it. For the last two options, Appinio (for Android) needs access to your identities, your media content, your camera and your microphone. Appinio can and will only use the permitted accesses for the functions mentioned above.\n4. Transfer of Data & Social Login\nWe make the data from your answers to surveys and quickies available to our partner companies in anonymous, statistically processed form, which does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about individual users, for the purpose of market research.\nIf we disclose data to other persons and companies (processors or third parties) in the course of our processing, transmit it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of a legal permission (e.g. if a transmission of data to third parties, such as payment service providers, is required for the performance of the contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR), you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.). If we commission third parties with the processing of data on the basis of a so-called \"order processing agreement\", this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.\nTo optimize our app we use Mixpanel (Mixpanel Inc, One Front Street, 28th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA). Pseudonymized usage data is transmitted to Mixpanel. Mixpanel is a US-based company that analyzes usage data on our behalf. The data processing may take place outside the European Union. Mixpanel assures us by contract that the European data protection regulations are observed.\nTo optimize our app we use UXCam (UXCam Inc. (814 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA, 94103, USA). Pseudonymized usage data is transmitted to UXCam Inc. UXCam Inc. is a US-based company that analyzes usage data on our behalf. The data processing may take place outside the European Union. UXCam Inc. assures us by contract that the European data protection regulations are observed.\nTo optimize our app we use Firebase from Google (Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Pseudonymized usage data is transmitted to Google. Google is a US-based company that analyzes usage data on our behalf. The data processing may take place outside the European Union. Google assures us by contract that the European data protection regulations are observed.\nTo optimize our marketing activities, we use the service provider Adjust (adjust GmbH, Saarbr\u00fccker Str. 37A, 10405 Berlin). The data collected via Adjust informs us, for example, about the download of the app, the online advertising channel through which the download was generated, the time the app was opened, the duration of app use and about particularly used app functions. Adjust uses IP and Mac addresses of the users for the analysis, which, however, are hashed after collection and are used by Adjust exclusively in pseudonymized form. The data is stored on the servers of adjust GmbH in Germany. Further information can be found in Adjust's privacy policy: https://www.adjust.com/privacy-policy/\nIn order to facilitate the registration process for our users, they are offered the option of opening a user account via an existing account with a third-party provider. If a user decides to use this registration method, the first step is to be redirected directly to the selected third-party provider. There, the user is requested by the respective third party provider to enter the access data in order to log in or register with the respective service. If the user is already logged in to the third-party provider with the end device at this point, this login prompt is skipped. You can recognize the login options in the app by the integrated logos of the respective third-party provider. Currently, we offer the option to register via an existing account of the following third-party providers:\nGoogle Sign-In: The user can register with his existing Google account. Google is operated by the company Google Inc, Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to the registration and use of Google's services.\nSign in with Apple: The user can register with his existing Apple account or Apple ID. This service is operated by Apple Inc, Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA. Apple's privacy policy applies to the registration and use of Apple's services.\nIf you use the option to register via one of the third-party providers, the app communicates with the servers of the respective provider, whereby name and e-mail address are read and linked to the user account.\nIn other respects, your personal data will only be disclosed without your express prior consent in the following cases:\n- If it serves to clarify an illegal platform use or is necessary for the prosecution, personal data are forwarded to the law enforcement authorities and possibly to injured third parties. However, this only happens if there are concrete indications of unlawful or abusive conduct. A transfer can also take place if this serves the enforcement of terms of use or other agreements. We are also legally obliged to provide information to certain public bodies upon request. These are criminal prosecution authorities, authorities that prosecute administrative offences subject to fines and the tax authorities.\n- As we develop our business, the structure of our company may change by changing its legal form, establishing, acquiring or selling subsidiaries, divisions or businesses. In such transactions, customer information is shared with the part of the business to be transferred. For each transfer of personal data to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that this is done in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant data protection laws.\n\u00dcbermittlungen in Drittl\u00e4nder: Sofern wir Daten in einem Drittland (d.h. au\u00dferhalb der Europ\u00e4ischen Union (EU) oder des Europ\u00e4ischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR)) verarbeiten oder dies im Rahmen der Inanspruchnahme von Diensten Dritter oder Offenlegung, bzw. \u00dcbermittlung von Daten an Dritte geschieht, erfolgt dies nur, wenn es zur Erf\u00fcllung unserer (vor)vertraglichen Pflichten, auf Grundlage Ihrer Einwilligung, aufgrund einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung oder auf Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen geschieht. Vorbehaltlich gesetzlicher oder vertraglicher Erlaubnisse, verarbeiten oder lassen wir die Daten in einem Drittland nur beim Vorliegen der besonderen Voraussetzungen der Art. 44 ff. GDPR verarbeiten. D.h. die Verarbeitung erfolgt z.B. auf Grundlage besonderer Garantien, wie der offiziell anerkannten Feststellung eines der EU entsprechenden Datenschutzniveaus (z.B. f\u00fcr die USA durch das \u201ePrivacy Shield\") oder Beachtung offiziell anerkannter spezieller vertraglicher Verpflichtungen (so genannte \u201eStandardvertragsklauseln\").\n5. Right of access and deletion\nIf your personal data are no longer required for the aforementioned purposes, they will be deleted, but at the latest after two years of inactivity.\nPlease note that uninstalling the application on your device does not automatically delete your data on our server. However, you can have your data deleted at any time by clicking on the \"Delete account\" button in our app or by contacting us via the contact options listed under paragraph 1 above.\nOf course, you have the right to request information about your personal data stored by us. You also have the right to correction of incorrect data, blocking and deletion. To do so, please contact us via the contact options listed under point 1 above. Furthermore, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge an appeal with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State where you are staying, working or suspected of infringing, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is contrary to the DSGVO.\nThe data processed by us will be deleted or their processing restricted in accordance with Art. 17 and 18 DSGVO. Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and there are no legal obligations to retain them. If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be restricted. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons.\n6. Changes to this data privacy policy\nWe always keep this data privacy policy up to date. Thus we reserve the right to change it from time to time and to update the collection, processing or use of your data.

understand who is responsible for keeping your data safe. We are the \"controller\" of all personal data collected and used for the purposes of providing All 4, including our All 4+ functionality, and for any other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This means that we are responsible for deciding how and why your data is used and for ensuring that your data is handled legally and safely.\n1.2 We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who has ultimate responsibility within Channel 4 for making sure your data is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the law. Our DPO can be contacted by emailing dataprotection@channel4.co.uk.\n2.1 We collect some data directly from you when you register for an account with All 4 (Account Data).

All 4+ Account Data includes:\n2.3.1 your card payment details (which will be collected directly by our third party payment provider, Stripe, and will not be visible to us); and\n2.3.2 your payment history for All 4+.\nThe collection and processing of your card details and payment data is also governed by Stripe\u2019s privacy policy, which you can find here: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy. The last four digits only of your payment card number are visible in your All 4 account.\n2.4 We collect and analyse information about how you use All 4 using cookies and similar technology (Behavioural Data). Behavioural Data includes your viewing history, IP addresses, device identifiers, what you\u2019ve watched including the ads you\u2019ve been shown and information about how long you have stayed on certain pages or what pages you have clicked on. You can find more detailed information about this in our Cookies Policy. We also log and use information about any service errors or interruptions that you have experienced in order to help us create fixes and to make technical improvements to All 4\n2.5 We also collect some data about you from third parties (Third Party Data). This includes:\n2.5.1 reputable data pairing providers, such as Acxiom, whom we have thoroughly checked. The data we obtain from Acxiom has been collected by Acxiom through publicly available records such as the electoral roll, from surveys or other companies that you engage with. Acxiom relies on your consent or their legitimate interests as the legal basis on which they share your data with us. The data that Acxiom shares with us may include data such as:\n(a) Basic demographic information (for example, your age and gender);\n(b) Regional location;\n(c) Household status (for example, if you own or rent your property);\n(d) Financial status and information about your life stage (for example, if you are married or have children);\n(e) Household makeup and composition (for example, the number of adults and children in your household and information about your and any partner\u2019s occupation);\n(f) Media habits (for example, which newspapers or TV channels you prefer);\n(g) Purchasing behaviours and domestic consumption habits (for example, whether you have a car, take holidays, or shop online);\n(h) Your and your household\u2019s hobbies and personal interests (for example, if you like crosswords or how often you like to eat out);\n(i) whether you use credit cards or have a pension or loan; and\n(j) Their unique identifier that they have assigned to you.\n2. 6 We collect information from our research panels. You can choose to sign up to research panels and respond to surveys and polls and these help us to understand our viewers' opinions, views and attitudes. If you sign up to a research panel which we run, like Core4, and complete our surveys or polls, we will collect information about you including your name, contact details and survey responses. We may also contact you directly by email to carry out research, for example about our products and services, any functionality that we offer or to find out more about your likes and interests to help tailor our products and services (including our advertising). You may also sign up to receive third party surveys from other research companies, like Dynata. The information we obtain from such research panels and surveys will only be gathered and used to help us inform our decisions regarding our products and services (including our advertising) (Survey Data). You can find more information about our research panels below.\n2.7 We collect information about you when you participate in our competitions, such as your contact information (Competition Data). This data is only used for the purposes of the relevant competition and will be subject to the terms and conditions of that competition, which will be notified to you when you enter the competition. If we share your data with a third party, such as a company that has sponsored the competition, we will tell you this when you enter the competition. Please see http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/comp-t-and-c for our general Competition Terms and Conditions.\n2. 8 We also collect publicly available information from social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat, for example likes, shares, tweets and posts about Channel 4, All 4, and all our programmes. This information is provided to us by a third party and is used for analysis purposes.\n3.1 It is important that you understand how and why we use the personal data that we collect about you. This section sets out the different purposes for which we process personal data and which types of personal data we need for each purpose.\n3.2 Managing your account and providing you with our services.\n3.2.1 We use your Account Data, Behavioural Data and All 4+ Account Data (if applicable) to set up, manage and administer your account, to respond to your queries, complaints or comments, to log you into your account and to provide you with All 4 and any other services that you request from us. In particular, we use your Behavioural Data to customise your All 4 homepage and the ads you see on our site, and to provide you with programme recommendations when you are logged into All 4. These are programmes that we think you will be interested in watching based on your viewing history.\n3.2.2 If you have signed up to access our All 4+ functionality, we use your All 4+ Account Data so we (and our payment processor Stripe) can process your payments and deal with any related queries you may have.\n3.2.3 We use your Account Data to contact you occasionally with service messages about All 4 and other products and services you have signed up for, for example to provide you with password reminders, where your account is due to expire, if there is an issue with your All 4+ account, or to contact you about content you have submitted to us. We will also use your contact details to contact you from time to time to ask you to participate in surveys to help us to improve our offerings. Data to help us with database matching. For more detail about this see Database matching.\n3.2.4 We use your Voluntary Data to enable us to respond to queries, complaints or comments that you have and to make sure that these are appropriately dealt with, for example when you contact Viewer Enquiries. Calls to our Viewer Enquiries number are recorded for training and monitoring purposes and retained for 2 years. If Voluntary Data you provide includes any special categories of personal data (such as information about your health, race or religion), you must make sure before you provide this that you are happy for us to use that Voluntary Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\n3.3 Competitions and surveys\n3.3.1 We use Competition Data for the purposes of allowing you to participate in competitions and to carry out any activities required in relation to those competitions, for example contacting you to let you know you have won a prize and using your address to send your prize to you.\n3.3.2 We use Survey Data for the purposes of analysing insights and information to enable us to improve our products and services and to help us to build more accurate ad targeting segments for our users.\n3.4 Improving our services\n3.4.1 We use Account Data, Behavioural Data, Voluntary Data and Survey Data to help us monitor, analyse and improve All 4 (including our All 4+ functionality). We use this data to help us understand which content and services are most interesting and enjoyable for our users and to help us identify errors and test features. This helps us to make sure that we are providing you with the best possible products and services.\n3.5 Compliance with contracts\n3.5.1 We use Behavioural Data to count programme views which enables us to pay rights holders for the content that you view.\n3.6 Marketing and advertising\n3.6.1 We use Account Data, Behavioural Data, Survey Data and Third Party Data for marketing and advertising purposes. For more information on the ways in which we do this, please see How do we use your data for marketing and advertising purposes? below.\n3.7 Profiling\n3.7.1 We combine all the different types of data that we hold about you in order to build up a picture of you and the types of products and services which might be of interest to you (your Profile). We will use your Profile to provide you with a more customised and tailored experience on All 4 and to inform the advertising that is displayed to you. This makes sure that you see advertisements (including personalised advertisements) that are relevant and interesting to you. If you opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertising on All 4, but this will not be specifically tailored to your interests.\n3.8 Research panels \u2013 for example Core4, Your4 and Dynata\n3.8.1 We use a number of research panels to conduct market research for us which may involve collecting personal data for the purposes of carrying out this research. This collection of personal data by third party research companies (such as Dynata) will be subject to separate privacy policies.\n3.8.2 We use Survey Data to:\n(a) enable us to assess our performance and to improve our products and services including advertising (including for profiling and for building our interest-based ad targeting models);\n(b) inform our marketing and promotional activities;\n(c) inform and support our advertising partners (e.g. helping us to report to them about campaign performance).\n3.9 We may use the personal data of relevant contributors in our programme listings.\n3.10 Archiving\n3.10.1 Channel 4 captures copies of the www.Channel4.com website and Channel 4 microsites to archive data that may be of historical or statistical value and to use this data for internal purposes or to allow third parties access to this data for research purposes, for example if someone is writing a book and the data we hold in our archives is useful for that book. Occasionally this may include copies of Voluntary Data that you have provided on public areas of the platform, or if you are contributor, information about you in relation to the programme you were in. We will only ever use personal data in this way that has already been made publicly available. Where possible, when the sites are archived we anonymise or remove personal data.\n3.10.2 We periodically review the data that we keep in our archive and we will delete or anonymise your data held in the archive where we consider it is no longer of value or interest.\n3.11 How we use anonymised data\n3.11.1 We use combined and anonymised data for certain purposes, such as to report viewing numbers of particular genres of programmes and help us understand what type of content users like and to share with advertisers so that they know how effective their advertising is. When used for these purposes, this data does not enable you or any other individual user to be identified.\n4.1 Apart from monthly fees paid by users of our All 4+ functionality, our programming is almost entirely funded by advertising revenue. Marketing and advertising are therefore key parts of our activities. This section sets out the various different types of marketing and advertising that we carry out and how your data is used for each type of activity. We do not serve targeted advertising to registered All 4 Users who are under 18.\n4.2 Email marketing\n4.2.1 We will use your email address to send you email marketing (including our newsletter, information about new shows or series you have set a reminder for, rewards and competitions) where you have signed up to receive this from us.\n4.2.2 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe in any of our email marketing communications or by changing your preferences in the \"My Communications\" section of your Account Settings. It may take up to 48 hours for your change in preference to take effect and the change will not affect any marketing emails which have already been scheduled to be sent in the future.\n4.2.3 If you opt out of email marketing, we will still need to send you service communications by email from time to time, such as information about changes to our services and updates to our policies.\n4.3 Personalised advertising\n4.3.1 We sometimes use your name, gender, location or your birth month to personalise advertisements that you see on the All 4 platform. This means, for example, that you may hear your first name in an audio/video advertisement or see your first name in a text advertisement.\n4.3.2 If you have opted out of targeted advertising, the advertisements you see will not be tailored to you and your interests, but they may still be personalised with your name, gender, location or birth month.\n4.3.3 You can opt out of personalised advertising at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings. It can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect.\n4.3.4 If you opt out of personalised advertisements without opting out of targeted advertising, you will still see targeted advertisements on All 4 but they will not be personalised with your name, gender or birth month.\n4.4 Data Pairing (Enrichment)\n4.4.1 We offer certain data-led targeted advertising products to advertisers, for which we \"enrich\" the data that we hold on All 4 registered users with data held on that individual by third party data providers such as Acxiom. This way, we can see which of our users fall into certain Acxiom segments that are popular with advertisers (e.g. segments based on household composition and interests) and enable advertisers to reach our registered users that fall into these categories on All 4. We do not offer these advertising products on iOS or tvOS devices.\n4.4.2 To carry out this data pairing exercise, we use reputable third party data providers such as Acxiom. Those data providers obtain personal data about you from publicly available sources and from other third parties who share your personal data on the basis of their legitimate interests or with your consent, in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices.\nWe vet data providers to ensure they comply with all their data protection obligations including explaining what they do with your data, keeping it secure and protecting it appropriately. We have a written agreement in place with all data providers we use and we monitor their activities to ensure they are complying with our contractual requirements.\n4.4.3 Data pairing works by sharing your Account Data with a data provider (e.g. Acxiom) so that they can enrich our data with personal data that they hold about you. If there is a match, we collect and store the additional Third Party Data (including, for example, the information listed in 2.5 above) in our data warehouse, Mediarithmics, so that advertisers can target specific audiences of All 4 users that are comprised of Acxiom\u2019s proprietary segments. Advertisers have no access to All 4 user data as part of this process. We conduct fresh database matches on a quarterly basis and process opt outs every two weeks.\nFor more information on Acxiom and the data it provides to companies like Channel 4, please visit https://www.acxiom.co.uk/about-acxiom/privacy/uk-privacy-policy/ and you can opt out of Acxiom\u2019s marketing data products here https://gdpr.eu.acxiom.com/managePreference\n4.4.4 We also conduct data pairing with research companies such as Dynata. We use Acxiom or a third party data matching company, Infosum, to find All 4 viewers on their database of individuals who have opted in to receive third party surveys. We enrich our All 4 data with behavioural information that people have voluntarily provided in response to these surveys.\n4.4.5 You can opt out of data pairing at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings. It can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect. If you opt out of data pairing, this means that your personal data held by us will no longer be combined with data held by data pairing providers. However, unless you also opt out of targeted advertisements, we will still use your data to target advertisements to you in accordance with the section headed Targeted advertisements below. This targeting will be based on your Account Data.\n4.5 Database matching\n4.5.1 We use email addresses (and/or other Account Data) to securely match our All 4 registered user database with the customer databases of some of our advertisers in order to show their ads to customers/users we have in common when they are logged into All 4 (except on iOS or tvOS devices). We never use sensitive data, known as special category data, for this purpose or the data of any of our registered users who are under 18.\n4.5.2 To do this, we usually use a third party matching company called Infosum, which uses proprietary technology to match its clients\u2019 data using secure data \"bunkers\". Both Channel 4 and the advertiser upload data into a secure bunker and neither party can access the other\u2019s bunker, nor can Infosum access the raw data in any bunker. The Infosum platform has proprietary controls which allow both Channel 4 and the advertiser to set permissions over their respective bunkers (e.g. to allow it to be matched). Once the data has been matched, the resulting list of matched All 4 users allows Channel 4 to activate the advertiser\u2019s campaign to those All 4 users. We process opt outs on a daily basis and advertisers are required to refresh the data in their bunkers every 28 days during the campaign to ensure good data hygiene.\n4.5.3 When we carry out this kind of ad campaign, we may also use modelling techniques within our data management platform, Mediarithmics, to identify additional All 4 registered users that share similar characteristics as those in the target group, such as interests and viewing habits \u2013 who we call \"lookalikes\" \u2013 so that we can target them with the same ad campaign.\n4.6 Targeted advertisements on All 4\n4.6.1 If we build a Profile about you (as set out under the section called Profiling) above, we will use this Profile to predict what products and services you will be interested in and to target advertisements for these types of products and services to you through All 4. These could be our own products and services or those of third party advertisers who have asked us to send their advertisements to certain categories of recipients, including recipients located in a specific geographic area or recipients we have identified are already a customer of the advertiser.\n4.6.2 In relation to advertisements for third party advertisers, when an advertiser is trying to reach a specific target audience, we may create target audiences for these advertisers, such as how many people of a particular age range (e.g. 18-34 year olds) or in a particular interest group (e.g. DIY enthusiasts) or in a particular location (e.g. users who live in Manchester). However these audiences are not shared with the advertiser in a way that enables individuals to be identified.\n4.6.3 Our third party advanced data platform, Mediarithmics, also provides advertisers with the opportunity to be able to build audience segments for targeting their ads on All 4 to individuals using a selection of Acxiom\u2019s proprietary pre-defined segments, such as your household composition, interests and financial status (as described above). We enable them to select the segment names of their choice but they never have access to your data as part of that process. We do not offer this option on iOS or tvOS devices.\n4.6.4 We tell our advertisers how many people in a particular audience have seen their specific advertisements and we provide them with your IP address so they can check that our viewing count is accurate. This process is usually carried out by a company appointed by the advertiser\u2019s advertising agency. This enables those advertisers to assess the effectiveness of their advertising.\n4.6.5 We may also share \"pseudonymised\" versions of your personal data with certain advertisers in order to help them carry out the targeting of advertisements on Channel 4\u2019s platforms. \"Pseudonymisation\" means that the relevant data will be changed from personal identifiable data to a coded version of that data. For example, we create anonymous temporary advertiser IDs for our users that we share with advertisers so they can cap the number of times you see a particular advertisement: however advertisers are not able to identify you from these IDs.\n4.6.6 You can opt out of targeted advertisements at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings. It can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect. If you opt out, we will still show you advertisements that are relevant to your country, region and city.\n4.6.7 We and other third parties also use cookies to assist in targeted advertising. You can find out more about this in our Cookies Policy.\n4.7 Promoting our own services on other platforms\n4.7.1 We also promote our own content and features via third party platforms, such as social media sites like Facebook.\n4.7.2 This usually works by us sending a hashed or encrypted identifier to the third party platform which is then matched to that third party's records in order to identify whether you are also a user of the third party's platform. If you are identified as a user, this allows us to send you promotions for Channel 4 content and features that we think you will be interested in via your homepage or profile on that platform. We do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.\n4.7.3 Once we have shown you a promotion for Channel 4 content and features on a third party platform, provided you have consented to the use of any cookies or equivalent technology, we may use a third party service provider to track whether or not, having seen the promotion, you then access All 4. You can choose to opt out of attribution tracking in our Cookies Policy. We do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.\n4.7.4 We may also make use of Facebook\u2019s business tools such as \"Facebook Pixel\" or \"Facebook SDK for App Events\". These tools enable us to send event information to Facebook (e.g. information about programmes that you have watched on All 4) so that they can report back to us about the impact of our Facebook marketing campaign on these events. This helps us to evaluate how effective our marketing is in driving programme viewing. We do not do this on iOS or tvOS devices.\n4.7.5 Facebook acts as our data processor when it provides matching, measurement and analytics services to us when we use Facebook\u2019s business tools.\n4.7.6 We are joint data controllers with Facebook Ireland when we share Event Data with Facebook Ireland to help target our marketing campaigns, create custom-made audiences and also improve ad delivery and optimisation of our marketing campaigns on Facebook. We have entered into Facebook\u2019s standard joint data controller agreement in accordance with the terms for the use of the relevant Facebook Business Tools: https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum.\n4.7.7 Facebook also acts independently as a data controller when it combines our user Event Data with the Event Data from other advertisers to improve and refine its ad targeting algorithm to help it deliver more personalised ads to its users. Further information about how Facebook processes your personal data, including the legal basis Facebook Ireland relies on and the ways to exercise your rights under GDPR against Facebook Ireland, can be found in Facebook Ireland\u2019s Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy. More information about the security measures that Facebook uses can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/data_security_terms.\n4.7.8 We rely on legitimate interests as a legal basis for the processing of your personal data for the targeted promotion of our content on third party platforms. You can opt out of receiving this type of marketing on other platforms at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings. We will process this request as quickly as possible but you might continue to see our promoted messages whilst your instruction is being administered.\n4.7.9 Our content might appear on third party sites based solely on your behaviours on these sites (for example, after liking our brand or its content on Facebook), or the behaviours of those within your networks (for example, a friend within your Facebook network likes our brand or its content on Facebook, so it appears in your News Feed). These branded messages are controlled by the third party site, but you may be able to update your preferences to stop these messages appearing in future (for example, you can customise your News Feed in Facebook via \u2018News Feed Preferences\u2019).\n4.8 Broadcaster Sharing\n4.8.1 Sometimes we will also share your Profile, or part of it, with reputable third parties such as other broadcasters to help them to target their own advertising on their own platforms. This helps to ensure that those third parties have as full a picture of you as possible and they can therefore target relevant advertisements to you on their own platforms that you will find interesting and helpful.\n4.8.2 This data pairing applies where you have also shared your personal data with that third party in the course of using their service. The broadcaster then shares your data with us, and we combine it with any personal data we hold about you. If there is a match, we pass the broadcaster the information we hold about you, for example information about your lifestyle, interests and viewing habits. The broadcasters use this information to show you advertisements that are relevant to your interests.;\n4.8.3 Those third parties will be responsible for how they use the data that we share with them and how they advertise to you using that data.\n4.9 Push notifications\n4.9.1 If you download the All 4 app, some of the communications that we send to you, including marketing communications, content recommendations and information about new content or features, may be sent by push notification. Push notifications are messages that pop up on your mobile device. You can choose whether or not to receive push notifications from the All 4 app through your device settings.\n4.9.2 If you use an Android device, your device will automatically opt you in for push notifications and you will need to turn these off if you don't want to receive them. If you use an Apple device, you will be asked when you set up your device if you want to receive push notifications and you can choose to receive them then. If you change your mind, you can change your preferences at any time in your device settings.\n4.10 Preference centre and opting out\n4.10.1 You can manage your advertising preferences at any time through the \"My communications\" and \"Privacy settings\" sections of your Account Settings. These sections enable you to choose the electronic marketing and advertising you are happy to receive.\n4.10.2 We will always respect your preferences but please note that it can take up to 72 hours for changes to your preferences to take effect. This may mean that you see some advertising that you have opted out of for a short time after opting out. Some advertising campaigns are also set up to run for a particular time and we are unable to change these settings once they are set up. If that is the case, we will make sure that you are opted out of future campaigns, but you may continue to see advertising relating to a particular campaign if the campaign is ongoing at the time you have opted out.\n4.10.3 Even if you opt out of all marketing and personalised/targeted advertising above, we will still show advertisements while you watch All 4 based on your broad geographical location, unless you have paid for our All 4+ functionality (in which case you will not see any ads in most of the content on All 4). These advertisements will not be personalised or targeted to you (other than on the basis of your broad location). They will be standard advertisements that will be served to every user in a relevant country, region or city area, who has opted out of personalisation and targeting of advertisements. We will also still customise your All 4 homepage and the promotional clips you see for other programmes on All 4, based on your viewing history as we consider this to be an integral part of our service.\n4.10.4 If you want to opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to do this through your device settings. Please see the section headed Push notifications above for more information.\n5.1 Data protection law says that we must tell you the legal basis that we rely on to process your personal data for the purposes that we have notified to you. This section tells you what that legal basis is in relation to each of the purposes set out above.\n5.2 With the exception of email marketing and processing of payment data for All 4+ subscribers, we process your personal data for all of the purposes identified under What do we use your data for?and How do we use your data for marketing and advertising purposes? above on the basis that it is in our legitimate interests, or the legitimate interests of third parties with whom we share your data, to carry out these activities. Further information about what those interests are is set out below.\nPurpose: Running your account and providing you with our services\nLegitimate interests: To ensure that All 4 users enjoy the best experience possible, to help us deliver our remit as a public service broadcaster and to lead to increased viewing and therefore increased funding for our programming content.\nPurpose: Improving our services\nLegitimate interests: To make sure that we continue to improve our service and provide our users with the best and most effective service possible.\nPurpose: Advertising\nLegitimate interests: To provide advertising that is relevant to you to ensure that you have the best experience possible of using All 4 or third party broadcasters' platforms, as well as to generate more advertising revenue so that we can put more funding back into the free content and services we are able to provide to you.\nPurpose: Profiling\nLegitimate interests: To provide a customised experience of our All 4 platform to ensure you have the best experience possible of using All 4, as well as to generate more advertising income which in turn allows us to put more funding back into the free content and services we are able to provide to you. Where we use profiling to assist other broadcasters to target their advertising, we do this on the basis of the third party broadcasters' legitimate interests in ensuring they can deliver appropriate, relevant and effective advertising on their platforms.\n5.3 You have the right to object to us processing your personal data for the purposes set out above. Unless we can show that we have a compelling legitimate reason to continue processing your personal data, we will stop processing it.\n5.4 In respect of the use of your email address for email marketing purposes, we process this on the basis that we have your consent to do so. You can withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to \"unsubscribe\" in any email marketing communications.\n5.5 If you have signed up to use our All 4+ functionality, we process your All 4+ Account Data to enrol you and take payments because it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you.\n6. 1 As well as the collection and use of personal data set out above, we also collect data through our 4sales website (www.4sales.com) and our press and information website (www.channel4.com/info/press/press-packs). The information that we collect through these sites is primarily business information which does not identify a particular individual. However, we will collect some personal data about individual users who sign up to these areas of our platforms, such as individual journalists or employees at companies who sign up for sales information.\n6.2 The personal data we collect through our sales website will be limited to your full name, email address, job title, company name and your email preferences. We will use this data to manage and administer your account and to send you the sales information that you request.\n6.3 The personal data we collect when you sign up to the press and information website will be the same as the Account Data described above, plus your press credentials. We will use this data to manage and administer your account and to send you press packs and daily alerts and updates that you request. You can sign up for daily alerts without having an account. If you do this, we collect your first name, surname, email address, job title and company name.\n6.4 We process this personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that we communicate effectively with actual and potential sponsors and advertisers and with the press. This ensures that we can continue to generate sufficient revenue to fund our programming activities.\n7.1 We are required under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to provide certain information in response to Freedom of Information requests. You can make a request by emailing FOIAdmin@Channel4.co.uk or by using our request form. In order to respond to requests, we will need to collect your name, address, email address, phone number and information about your request, including any additional personal data you choose to share with us when you make your request. We will use this personal data to respond to your request and will retain it for administrative purposes in line with the section headed How long do we keep your data for? below.\n7.2 For more information about Freedom of Information, please see here.\n8.1 If you use Google Home, you can link your Google account to your All 4 account to log you into your All 4 account, enable you to use voice control to play All 4 content on compatible devices or to ask for information about All 4. If you do this, an authentication token will be generated. This authentication token is shared with Google to enable us to identify your account when you use voice control to control All 4 via Google Home.\n8.2 When you use voice control to control All 4 (for example, by saying \"OK Google, play Hollyoaks on All 4\") or to ask for information about All 4, this instruction is made directly to Google and is subject to Google's own privacy policy. Your voice instruction will initiate a playback request which tells us what you want us to do (for example, play Hollyoaks on your account). Google will share the playback request with us, together with your authentication token and a transcription of your voice instruction that initiated the playback request, so that we can action your playback request (for example, by playing Hollyoaks on your All 4 account). We will keep records of your voice instructions that relate to All 4 and will use these for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\n8.3 If you decide to unlink your All 4 account and your Google account, Google will delete the authentication token associated with your account and no further data will be shared between us and Google unless you decide to link your accounts again. Google will retain records of voice instructions you have issued in relation to All 4 as part of your history and in accordance with Google's own privacy policy. We will also retain copies of the playback requests and transcriptions of voice instructions in accordance with the section headed How long do we keep your data for?\n8.4 We also use Google reCAPTCHA, which is a system that helps us prevent automated access to our site by computer programmes known as \"bots\". reCAPTCHA does this by working out if you are a human or a bot, by collecting certain information from your browser / device like the cookies Google has placed over the last 6 months, how many mouse clicks you\u2019ve made on that page (or touches if it\u2019s a touch device), and the language of your browser.\n8.5 Google\u2019s DV360 product enables advertising agencies to buy All 4 advertising inventory on behalf of their clients. We allow agencies to measure how many times the advertisements are delivered \u2013 called \"impression counting\". This is done by our ad-serving platform sending a copy of your IP address to DV360 once the advertisement has played out.\n8.6 Google may use the information they collect as part of the processes described above for additional purposes, details of which can be found here along with the ways you can control what Google does with that information: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.\n9.1 We do need to share your personal data with some third parties in some circumstances. This includes where we use third party suppliers to perform various services for us. When we share your personal data with third parties, we enter into contracts to ensure your personal data is kept secure, is only used for the defined purpose, and is then deleted in accordance with our data retention requirements.

Channel 4 only ever receives the last four digits of your payment card. The full payment card details are sent directly to Stripe.\n9.2 We will share your personal data with the following categories of recipients for the following purposes:\n9.2.1 third party data pairing providers for the purposes of the data pairing exercise described under the section headed Data pairing above;\n9.2.2 third party platforms to enable us to serve you advertisements send you recommendations for our content and services through those platforms, as described in the section headed Promoting our own services on other platforms above;\n9.2.3 third party media agencies, in which case data will be shared in a pseudonymised form as described in the section headed Targeted advertising on All 4 above; and\n9.2.4 other broadcasters and publishers where we act as advertising sales agent on their behalf to enable us to target and serve advertisements for those broadcasters and publishers.\n9.3 We will also share your personal data with third parties in the following circumstances:\n9.3.1 where you have specifically consented to us sharing your data with a particular third party; and\n9.3.2 where we are required or permitted to do so by law or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party.\n9.4 Except as stated in paragraph 9.5, we do not transfer or store your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). If we do carry out any further transfers of your data outside the EEA, we will inform you and we will ensure that the recipient provides an adequate level of protection of your personal data.\n9.5 We transfer personal data outside of the EEA in the following ways:\nActivity: If you use Google Home features with your All 4 account, or sign in with Google reCAPTCHA, Google will store your data.\nLocation: Google stores data in the USA\nSafeguards: Google use EC approved standard contractual clauses to cover the international transfer of personal data https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=en-GB\nActivity: We use a third party platform, Innovid, to help us deliver personalised advertising.\nLocation: Innovid stores data in the USA\nSafeguards: Innovid use EC approved standard contractual clauses to cover the international transfer of personal data\nActivity: We use a third party payment processor, Stripe, to process card payments for All 4+ users.\nLocation: Stripe stores data in the USA\nSafeguards: Stripe use EC approved standard contractual clauses to cover the international transfer of personal data.

The use of that information will be governed by the social media platform's own privacy policy and clicking the \"share\" buttons does not result in any other personal data being shared between All 4 and the platform.\n10.1 We will keep all your personal data except for All 4+ payment card details for as long as your All 4 account remains open. You can close your account at any time using the \"Close account\" section of your Account Settings. If you do this, we will anonymise all your Account Data as soon as we can after you have closed your account. All other information about you, such as Behavioural Data, will also be fully anonymised.\n10.2 If you have signed up to All 4+ and decide to cancel your All 4+ account, or if we cancel your account due to non-payment, we will instruct Stripe, our third party payment processer, to delete your payment method details from your account. We will keep the rest of your All 4+ Account Data (e.g. your payment records) for up to six years.\n10.3 If your account is inactive for a period of two years, we will send you a reminder email to remind you to use your account. If you still do not use your account, we will send a further reminder email before deleting your account and anonymising your personal data as set out above.\n10.4 We may need to keep your data after account closure for limited purposes, for example if we need your data in order to respond to any complaints or claims that you make. If this is the case, we will only keep the data for as long as we need to in order to fulfil those purposes.\n10.5 We keep information relating to any service errors or interruptions you have experienced for between 15-30 days.\n10.6 Any Voluntary Data you submit to us will be retained for a period of two years from submission, after which it is anonymised or deleted.\n11.1 You have several rights under data protection law. These rights and how you can exercise them are set out in this section. We will normally need to ask you for proof of your identity before we can respond to a request to exercise any of the rights in this section and we may need to ask you for more information, for example to help us to locate the personal data that your request relates to.\n11.2 We will respond to any requests to exercise your rights as soon as we can and in any event within one month of receiving your request and any necessary proof of identity or further information. If your request is particularly difficult or complex, or if you have made a large volume of requests, we may take up to three months to respond. If this is the case we will let you know as soon as we can and explain why we need to take longer to respond.\n11.3 A right to access your information\n11.3.1 You can access all of your Account Data through the \"Personal details\" section of your Account Settings.\n11.3.2 You also have a right to ask us to send you a copy of your Account Data and all other personal data that we hold about you (subject to some exceptions). A request to exercise this right is called a \"subject access request\" (SAR) and must be made in writing to: dataprotection@channel4.co.uk or to: Data Protection Officer, Channel 4 Enquiries, PO Box 1058, Belfast, BT1 9DU.\n11.3.3 We do not accept subject access requests made via third parties without a letter of authorisation from you sent directly to us confirming that you authorise the third party to act on your behalf. We do not accept SAR requests from platforms where we are required to set up an account in order to provide the response to the SAR.\n11.4 A right to object to us processing your information\n11.4.1 You have a right to object to us processing any personal data that we process where we are relying on legitimate interests as the legal basis of our processing. This includes all of your personal data that we process for all of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, with the exception of our use of your email address to send you marketing communications with your consent (but you can withdraw your consent to this at any time).\n11.4.2 If we have compelling legitimate grounds to carry on processing your personal data, we will be able to continue to do so.

If you ask us to delete your personal data but you do not want your account closed, we may not be able or obliged to comply with this as we will usually need to keep processing your data in a personally identifiable form to keep your account open.\n11.7.4 If you would like to make a request to exercise this right, please email dataprotection@channel4.co.uk.

Does Binance Share My Personal Information?\nInformation about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others. Binance shares users' personal information only as described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Binance that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.\nThird party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws.\nBusiness transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.\nProtection of Binance and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Binance, our users or others.

How Secure is My Information?\nWe design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.\nWe maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account password. We recommend using a unique password for your Binance account that is not utilized for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.\n7. What About Advertising?\nIn order for us to provide you the best user experience, we may share your personal information with our marketing partners for the purposes of targeting, modeling, and/or analytics as well as marketing and advertising.

Exercising this right does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given before the withdrawal of the latter;\n- Right to define the instructions relating to the use of your personal data post mortem: you have the right to define instructions relating to the retention, deletion and communication of your Data after your death;\n- Right to lodge complaint to the relevant data protection authority.\n10.

The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You\nWe may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you online with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Application. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.\n(d) Information You Provide About A Third Party\nIf you send someone else an electronic communication from the Application, such as sending an invitation to a friend to join the Application, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.

What About Information I Disclose Publicly?\n(a) User Generated Content and Public Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or otherwise share using the Application. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any content or information that you share publicly through the Application.\n6. Does Third Party Content And Links To Third Party Sites Appear in the Application?\nThe Application may contain content that is supplied by a third party (such as a charity or sponsor), and those third parties may collect web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from the Application are served to your browser. In addition, when you are using the Application you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third party sites. For example, if you \"click\" on a charity\u2019s or sponsor\u2019s banner, the \"click\" may take you off the Application onto a different web site. These other web sites may appear in \"baby browsers\" within the Application and may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Application and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites before submitting any Personal Information to those sites.\n7. Are There Third Party Ads Served On The Application?\nAlthough we feature content from our charities and sponsors in the Application, we do not currently use network advertisers to serve advertisements (such as banner advertisements) in the Application. However, in the future, we may use third-party network advertisers to serve you advertisements in the Application. We may also use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Application and viewing of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Application and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Application\u2019s third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including flash cookies), web beacons and other tracking technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third party cookies (including flash cookies), web beacons and other tracking technologies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies (including flash cookies) and web beacons are governed by each third party\u2019s specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Application, you may wish to visit HYPERLINK \"http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp\" http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the \"opt-out\" procedures of NAI members. This Privacy Policy does not cover the methods for collecting information used by these third party advertisers or the use of the information that such advertisers collect. We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of third party network advertisers.\n8. How Do I Change My Information And Communication Preferences?\nYou are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. You can make any necessary changes to this information through your Facebook account.\n9. What About Consent To Transfer Information To The United States?\nThe Application is operated in the United States. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including, Personal Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Application or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.\n10.

We will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at: privacy@charitymiles.org.\n11. What About Security?\nWe incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. We maintain physical, electronic and managerial practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information. We limit and restrict access to Personal Information only to those employees who need it to carry out their business functions. We also educate our employees about safeguarding Personal Information and preventing its unauthorized access, disclosure or use. Our employees with access to Personal Information are also bound to adhere to this policy. We will monitor and adopt, as appropriate, new technological improvements that are designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of customer information.\nHowever, no transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Application and provide us with your information at your own risk.\n12. What About Changes To The Privacy Policy?\nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected without your consent.\n13.

If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Slack\u2019s business.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Slack platform (\u2018Third-Party Services\u2019), or any other third-party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the \u2018Customer Agreement\u2019), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, \u2018Customer Data\u2019). The organisation (e.g. your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (the \u2018Customer\u2019) controls its instance of the Services (its \u2018Workspace\u2019) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check http://slack.com/account/team for the contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.\nInformation we collect and receive\nSlack may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (\"Other Information\") in a variety of ways:\n- Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (\"Authorised Users\") routinely submit Customer Data to Slack when using the Services.\n- Other Information. Slack also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:\n-- Workspace and account information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g. your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. For details on Workspace creation, click here. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.\n-- Usage information.\n--- Services metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that Authorised Users work. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links that you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any).\n--- Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.\n--- Device information. Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.\n--- Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third parties that helps us to approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine your approximate location. Slack may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.\n-- Cookie information. Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out opportunities and other options, please see our Cookie policy.\n-- Third-Party Services. A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorised Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace. Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorised Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorised Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorised to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the Third-Party Provider and any permission(s) granted by the Customer (including by its Authorised User(s)). We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Third-Party Services, click here.\n-- Contact information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorised User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device or API) is collected when using the Services.\n-- Third-Party data. Slack may receive data about organisations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information that we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to postcodes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.\n-- Additional information provided to Slack. We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, enrol in a certification programme or other educational programme hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.\nGenerally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively \"Information\"). However, certain Information is collected automatically and if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.\nHow we use information\nCustomer Data will be used by Slack in accordance with the Customer\u2019s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Slack is a Processor of Customer Data and the Customer is the Controller. The Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.\nSlack uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, Slack uses Other Information:\n- To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business. This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyse and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorised User\u2019s request.\n- As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.\n- To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions. If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.\n- To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features. Slack tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorised Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorised User, make Services or Third-Party Service suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, or identify organisational trends and insights to customise a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.\n- To send emails and other communications. We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Slack. These are marketing messages, so you can control whether or not you receive them. If you have additional questions about a message that you have received from Slack, please get in touch through the contact mechanisms described below.\n- For billing, account management and other administrative matters. Slack may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.\n- To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.\nIf Information is aggregated or de-identified so that it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Slack may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as \"Personal Data\".\nData retention\nSlack will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Depending on the Services subscription, the Customer may be able to customise its retention settings and apply those customised settings at the Workspace level, channel level or other level. The Customer may also apply different settings to messages, files or other types of Customer Data. The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by the Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information. For more detail, please review the Help Centre or contact the Customer. Slack may retain Other Information pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for Slack to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\nHow we share and disclose information\nThis section describes how Slack may share and disclose Information, as described in the section entitled \u2018Information we collect and receive\u2019 above. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information. Slack does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.\n- The Customer\u2019s instructions. Slack may share and disclose Information in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions and with appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Some sharing at a Customer\u2019s request may incur additional fees.\n- Displaying the Services. When an Authorised User submits Information, it may be displayed to other Authorised Users in the same or connected Workspaces. For example, an Authorised User\u2019s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile. Please consult the Help Centre for more information on Services functionality.\n- Collaborating with others. The Services provide different ways for Authorised Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate, such as Slack Connect or email interoperability. Information, such as an Authorised User\u2019s profile Information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the other Workspace(s).\n- Customer access. Owners, administrators, Authorised Users and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify or restrict access to Information. This may include, for example, your employer using Service features to export logs of Workspace activity, or accessing or modifying your profile details. For information about your Workspace settings, please see https://slack.com/account/settings.\n- Third-Party Service Providers and Partners. We may engage third-party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process Information and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services, or we may share business information to develop strategic partnerships with Third-Party Service providers to support our common customers. Additional information about the subprocessors that we use to support delivery of our Services is set forth at Slack subprocessors.\n- Third-Party Services. Customer may enable or permit Authorised Users to enable Third-Party Services. We require each Third-Party Service to disclose all permissions for information access in the Services, but we do not guarantee that they do so. When enabled, Slack may share Information with Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services are not owned or controlled by Slack and third parties that have been granted access to Information may have their own policies and practices for its collection, use and sharing. Please check the permissions, privacy settings and notices for these Third-Party Services, or contact the provider if you have any questions.\n- Forums. The information that you choose to provide in a community forum, including personal data, will be publicly available.\n- Corporate affiliates. Slack may share Information with its corporate affiliates, parents and/or subsidiaries.\n- During a change to Slack\u2019s business. If Slack engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation, sale of some or all of Slack\u2019s assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding or steps in contemplation of such activities, some or all Information may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.\n- Aggregated or deidentified Data. We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified Information for any purpose. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified Information with prospects or partners for business or research\n- To comply with laws. If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Information if we reasonably believe that disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process. Please see the Data request policy, Data request overview and Transparency report to understand how Slack responds to requests to disclose data from government agencies, law enforcement entities and other sources.\n- To enforce our rights, prevent fraud and for safety. To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Slack, its users or third parties, including enforcing its contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing illegal activity, fraud or security issues, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.\n- With consent. Slack may share Information with third parties when we have consent to do so. For workspaces registered to corporate entities, Slack may share Information with consent of the workspace primary owner or authorised corporate officer. For workplaces created without a formal affiliation, Slack may require user consent.\nSecurity\nSlack takes security of data very seriously. Slack works hard to protect Information that you provide from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Information that we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. Slack has received internationally recognised security certifications. To learn more about current practices and policies regarding security and confidentiality of the Services, please see our Security practices. Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, Slack cannot guarantee that Information during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. When you click a link to a third-party site, you will be leaving our site, and we don\u2019t control or endorse what is on third-party sites.\nAge limitations\nTo the extent prohibited by applicable law, Slack does not allow use of our Services and Websites by anyone younger than 16 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\nSlack may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our services or business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review our Privacy Policy to stay informed. If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, Slack will provide additional notice, such as via email or through the Services. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should deactivate your Services account. Contact the Customer if you wish to request the removal of Personal Data under their control.\nInternational data transfers\nSlack may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live. To the extent that Personal Data is transferred abroad, Slack will ensure compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws in the respective jurisdiction in line with Slack\u2019s obligations.\nIn particular, we offer the following safeguards if Slack transfers Personal Data from jurisdictions with differing data protection laws:\n- European Union Model Clauses. Slack offers European Union Model Clauses (\u2018Model Clauses\u2019), also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, and for other international transfers of Customer Data as relevant. A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating Model Clauses, is available here.\n- EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield. While Slack Technologies, LLC (formerly, Slack Technologies, Inc.) (\u2018Slack US\u2019) remains self-certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, it is not currently relying on these frameworks for the transfer of personal data. For more information, including the types of information covered, see Slack US\u2019s Privacy Shield Notice. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Programme, please see http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.\n- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Privacy Rules System and Privacy Recognition For Processors. Slack\u2019s privacy practices, described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (\u2018APEC\u2019) Cross Border Privacy Rules (\u2018CBPR\u2019) system and the Privacy Recognition for Processors (\u2018PRP\u2019). The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organisations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies, and the PRP demonstrates an organisation\u2019s ability to provide effective implementation of a personal data controller\u2019s privacy obligations related to the processing of personal information. More information about the APEC framework can be found here.\n- If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern related to our APEC, CBPR or PRP certifications that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may contact our third-party dispute resolution provider.\nData Protection Officer\nTo communicate with our Data Protection Officer, please email dpo@slack.com.\nIdentifying the Data Controller and Processor\nData protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the \u2018controller\u2019 and \u2018processor\u2019 of information. In general, the Customer is the controller of Customer Data. In general, Slack is the processor of Customer Data and the controller of Other Information. Different Slack entities provide the Services in different parts of the world. Slack Technologies Limited, an Irish company based in Dublin, Ireland, is the controller of Other Information and a processor of Customer Data relating to Authorised Users who use Workspaces established for Customers outside of the US and Canada. Slack Technologies, LLC, a US company based in San Francisco, California, is the controller of Other Information and a processor of Customer Data relating to Authorised Users who use Workspaces established for Customers in the US and Canada.\nYour rights\nIndividuals across the globe, including the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Brazil, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request access to Information, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct this Information. You can usually do this using the settings and tools provided in your Services account. If you cannot use the settings and tools, contact the Customer who controls your workspace for additional access and assistance. Please check https://slack.com/account/settings for Customer contact information.\nTo the extent that Slack\u2019s processing of your Personal Data is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation or other applicable laws covering the processing of Personal Data such as the UK Data Protection Act and the Brazilian General Data Protection Act (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados), Slack relies on its legitimate interests, described above, to process your data. Slack may also process Other Information that constitutes your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, and you have a right to object to Slack\u2019s use of your Personal Data for this purpose at any time.\nYour California privacy rights\nThis section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or \"CCPA\".\nFor more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the Information we collect and receive section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How we use information section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the How we share and disclose information section above. Slack does not sell (as the term is defined in the CCPA) the personal information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Please note that we do use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes as further described in our Cookie policy.\nSubject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any \"sales\" that may be occurring and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.\nCalifornia consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at privacy@slack.com.

These vendors process your data only at and according to Supercell\u00b4s instructions to provide the Service, and perform tasks such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.\nOther companies and public authorities.\nIn order to verify payments (with payment providers such as Paypal) and combat fraud and illegal activity, we may process and disclose data with other companies and organizations and provide it to public authorities in response to lawful requests.\nWe may also disclose your data based on your consent, to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others.\nAdvertising and Social Media partners.\nThe Service includes features from our partners, such as social media interaction tools, functionalities through application programming interfaces (APIs) or software development kits (SDKs) and in-game advertising. A list of these partners is available at supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out. These partners may access your data and operate under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their data processing practices.\nThese partners may access data regarding your activities and your device (such as your IP address, mobile identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). We may also combine and share data we have collected about you with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this data (and similar data collected from other services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party services within their networks. These partners may operate under their own privacy policies. This practice is commonly referred to as \"interest-based advertising\" or \"online behavioral advertising.\" If you prefer not to share your personal data with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions in \"Your Rights and Options\" below.\nINTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS\nOur Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy. Adequate safeguards that we may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and other lawful safeguards.\nYOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS\nOpt out of marketing emails and other direct marketing.\nYou may opt out of receiving promotional communications, such as marketing emails from us by following the instructions in such communications, or by changing your in-game settings. The updated settings may not be effective immediately. Note that you may still continue to receive non-promotional communications from us, such as communications regarding the Service or updates to our Supercell Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.\nPush Notifications\nWe may send you push notifications through our mobile applications. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device.\nOpt-out of targeted advertising.\nYou can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and turning off \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" or selecting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" (Apple iOS) or \"Opt-out of Interest Based Ads\" (Android). For more information, see also: supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out.\nYou can also opt out from personalized in-game offers through the options provided in the game settings (where applicable).\nAccess the personal data we hold about you.\nIf you request, we will provide you a copy of your personal data in an electronic format.\nYour other rights.\nYou also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object how we use or share your data, and restrict how we use or share your data. You can always withdraw your consent.\nWe will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may also contact your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area, Switzerland or UK for unresolved complaints.\nIf you wish to exercise any of your data subject rights described above, please use the support options described in \"Contact Us\" above. We will respond to all requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we may also take additional steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request, such as by requesting you provide us a purchase receipt or other account information, asking you to link your email address with your game account (for example through Supercell ID), or asking you to answer questions regarding your activities on our Services. Once you have verified your identity, you may also designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights on your behalf by providing the agent\u2019s contact information to our customer support staff, as required by applicable law.\nYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment as a result of your exercise of these rights.\nCOOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES\nLike most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. Cookies and similar technologies allow us and our partners to store their preferences and track your activities within the Service. Note that our partners may operate under their own privacy policies.\nWe and our partners collect and store information about users' interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies. This allows us to infer the presence of a common user or household behind multiple devices or browsers, for instance, and then link those browsers and devices into a device graph. We do so in order to\n- detect and prevent fraud;\n- allow users to use the Service on one device and pick up seamlessly where they left off on another device;\n- analytics, personalization and attribution;\n- limit the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement, across all known or inferred devices; and/or\n- provide personalized advertising on each device that is inferred from the browsing patterns on all of the devices.\nFor more information (including how to opt out), please visit https://supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out/. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.\nHOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA\nSecurity Safeguards.\nIn order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.\nData retention.\nWe retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We may for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts, and we may regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.\nNote that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nCHILDREN\nProtecting children\u2019s privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect personal data from children, except as described in the following paragraph.\nFor games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the player\u2019s age. For these Services, when a player indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media and chat features, as well as certain types of notification alerts. We also limit the processing of personal data to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.\nPlease note that for some of our Services we may use a higher age limit (such as 16) than described in the above two paragraphs. We do this to provide a safe game experience for our players and to protect Young Players.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and wish to review personal data collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described above. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data contrary to the above, we will delete any personal data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child\u2019s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.\nFOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS\nPlease visit supercell.com/en/disclosure-california-residents for special disclosures pertaining to California residents.\n"}]}, {"title": "2fas", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"id":

2021\nIntroduction\nTikTok is a platform for creating and sharing short-form videos (the \"Platform\"). This privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with the Platform and other TikTok-related applications, websites, products, and services that link to or reference this Privacy Policy (collectively, the \"Services\").\nData Controller: If you live in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), the UK, or Switzerland, TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (\"TikTok Ireland\"), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (\"TikTok UK\"), a UK company, (\"TikTok,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" or \"us\") are the joint controllers of any information processed in connection with this Privacy Policy.\nWhat Information We Collect\nWe collect three categories of information: Information You Provide, Automatically Collected Information, and Information From Other Sources. More detail about each of the categories is provided below.\nInformation You Provide\n- Profile Information. We collect information that you provide when you set up your TikTok account, such as your date of birth, username, email address and/or telephone number, and password. You can add other information to your profile, such as a bio or a profile photo.\n- User Content. We collect the content you create or publish through the Platform, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, livestreams, and comments, and the associated metadata (such as when, where, and by who the content was created). We collect User Content through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that User Content, for example, to recommend music based on the video. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between the Platform and a third party platform.\n- Direct Messages. When you communicate with others using direct messages, we collect the content of the message and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We do this to block spam, detect crime, and to safeguard our users.\n- Your Contacts. When you choose to import your contacts, we will collect information from your device\u2019s phone book or your social media contacts. We use this information to help you make connections on the Platform when you are using our \"Find Friends\" function and to suggest your account to others.\n- Purchase Information. We collect your payment card information or other third-party payment information (such as PayPal) where payment is required. We also collect your transaction and purchase history.\n- Surveys and Promotions. We collect information you provide if you choose to participate in one of our surveys, promotions, contests, or marketing campaigns or events.\n- Information When You Contact Us. When you contact us, we collect the information you send us, such as proof of identity or age, feedback about your use of our Services or information about possible violations of our Terms of Service (our \"Terms\"), Community Guidelines (our \"Guidelines\"), or other policies.\nAutomatically Collected Information\n- Technical Information. We collect certain device and network connection information when you access any of our Services. This information includes your device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language. We also collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We automatically assign you a device ID and user ID when you use our Platform. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we use information such as your device ID and user ID to identify your activity across devices to give you a seamless log-in experience and for security purposes.\n- Location. We collect your approximate location based on your Technical Information (such as SIM card and IP address) to customise your experience and for diagnostics and troubleshooting. With your permission, we may also collect precise location information (such as GPS).\n- Usage Information. We collect information about how you engage with our Services, including information about the content you view, how long and how often you use our Services, how you engage with other users, your search history on the Platform, and your settings.\n- Content Characteristics and Features. We detect and collect characteristics and features about the video and audio recordings that are part of your User Content, for example, by identifying objects and scenery; the existence or location within an image of a face or other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your User Content. We do this, for example, for content moderation and to provide special effects (such as video filters and avatars) and captions.\n- Inferred Information. We infer your attributes (such as age-range and gender) and interests based on the information we have about you. We use inferences to, for example, keep our Platform safe, content moderation, and, where permitted, to serve you personalised ads based on your interests.\n- Cookies. We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and provide our Services. For example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences, make sure you don\u2019t see the same video more than once, and for security purposes. We also use these technologies for marketing purposes. To learn more about our use of cookies, please see our Web Cookies Policy and Platform Cookies Policy.

If you choose to sign-up for TikTok using a third party platform (such as Facebook or Google), the third party platform will share information such as your email address, user ID, and public profile.\n- Integration Partners. When you interact with any third party service (such as third party apps, websites or products) that integrate TikTok Developer Tools, we will receive the information necessary to provide you with features like cross-service authentication or cross-posting. For example, this will happen if you log in to another service with your TikTok account or if you use the TikTok \"share\" button on a third party service to share content from the third party service to TikTok.\n- Others. Other users or individuals may provide us with information about you, including if you are featured or mentioned in another user\u2019s content or direct messages, a complaint or feedback submitted by a third party, or if your contact information is provided to us by another user through our \"Find Friends\" function.\nHow We Use Your Information\nWe use your information to operate, provide, develop, and improve our Services, including for the following purposes.

and subject matter of this Privacy Policy\nWe, Gameforge 4D GmbH (\u2018Gameforge\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019), provide client and browser-based online games. On our platforms, which comprise our internet pages, forums, support, newsletter and online games (\u2018Gameforge services\u2019), we provide information and exchange about our games and their use. This should be as pleasant, fair and trouble-free as possible for all users. In order to ensure this and the long-term success of our services, Gameforge services are continuously improved.\nHere it is unavoidable that information about the individual user and their hardware is collected, stored and ultimately used to fulfil different purposes.\nThe trust of our community is of the utmost importance to us. In this Privacy Policy (\u2018Privacy Policy\u2019) covering the Gameforge services we wish to provide you with a complete picture of how we use your personal data and what rights you have with regard to this data. This Privacy Policy provides comprehensive information regarding the ways in which we process your data, what we do with your data and the legal basis upon which we do this.\nYour rights and our obligations regarding how we deal with your data have a very high priority for us. We only process your data where absolutely necessary, doing so in a secure and responsible manner, with the greatest care and attention to the legal requirements.\n1. Details regarding data controller and data protection officer\nWe want to live up to your trust. You can contact us for any questions, suggestions or complaints you may have regarding the way we handle your data in general, or with regards to this Privacy Policy in particular.\n1.1 Data controller\nThe data controller responsible for processing personal data is Gameforge 4D GmbH, Albert-Nestler-Strasse 8, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany. We can be contacted for general enquiries regarding data protection at the address provided, by email at info@gameforge.com, through our ticket support system or by fax message at +49 (0)721 354 808 152. Please submit your deletion requests (as per 6.3) at https://support.gameforge.com/ or via email at info@gameforge.com.\n1.2 Data protection officer contact details\nYou may also contact our data protection officer (Dr. Tobias Gr\u00e4ber, LL.M.) in confidence using the contact details provided above, by email at datenschutz@gameforge.com or by fax message at +49 (0)721 354 808 159.\n2. General information regarding data we process and how we collect it\nIn this section we inform you how we collect your data.\n2.1 Legal basis for processing data\nWe ensure from the moment of collecting your data that this is done in a reliable, transparent and appropriate manner. In judging whether we have the right to collect data, and how this data is to be processed, we orientate ourselves on the requirements of applicable law, in particular on the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019), the Data Protection Act of the Federal Republic of Germany and other legal provisions relating to the handling of personal data.\n2.2 Data automatically collected by us\nWhen using Gameforge services, system and user-related data is collected automatically and without any further action on the part of the user. For example, when you visit a Gameforge web page, the general specifications of your internet browser (e.g. type and version), time of access and the related IP address (an individual address associated with your internet connection at this time), as well as system configuration details (e.g. screen resolution and operating system version) are collected and recorded in server logs. As a rule, this information is not used to identify a specific internet user.\nIn the same way, when you log into a Gameforge account (e.g. when logging into a user account for our forums, support or one of our online games), corresponding data may be collected automatically. You can find more information about this in sections 3 to 5.\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company\u2019s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n2.3 Data generated by us\nIn the process of registering a Gameforge account, and during its subsequent use, we generate data at different times and for different reasons.\nThis includes an individual username. This identification (e.g. account or character IDs) serves the purpose of pseudonymisation and is required for technical reasons, for example for logging into and using a user account or for saving information concerning payment transactions separately. With regards to the data generated by us, this also includes data which may be recorded by our support team or community management for the purposes of carrying out their tasks. Where there is suspicion that there has been a violation of our rules of the game and Standard Terms of Use, this may include checking and documenting the facts of the case and, if necessary, issuing warnings, but potentially also comments in favour of the user concerned, such as special authorisations permitted in individual cases by the respective rules of the game.\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company\u2019s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n2.4 Data provided by you\nThe majority of the personal data we process is provided directly by our users. Basic information is collected when registering a Gameforge account (generally your email address and chosen pseudonym to identify your user account, your game characters and other game elements). As a rule, we do not collect any specific data such as the user\u2019s name, date of birth or address. In individual cases (e.g. during competitions) such data may be provided by the user.\nThe data provided by users also includes the content they have written (for example, texts written in a forum or within the game or other messages sent to us by a user).\nGenerally, the basic versions of online games offered by us can be used free of charge. However, the user has the option to purchase additional content. For such transactions, users therefore provide us with information that is required by us or our payment service providers in order to complete the payment.\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company\u2019s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of a user agreement (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n2.5 Data we collect from external sources\nIn some cases we receive personal data from third parties. This is primarily the case when using a third-party login (for example, when logging into Gameforge services via a Facebook or Steam account). The data thus obtained shall be limited to what is necessary for the login in question. However, the respective third-party provider is responsible for the scope of the transmitted data. We therefore recommend that you read the data protection regulations of the third-party provider carefully before using a corresponding login option.\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company\u2019s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n2.6 Voluntary provision and processing\nThe provision of personal data and the associated use of Gameforge services are entirely voluntary. The use of Gameforge services, however, may require the provision and processing of certain data for technical or contractual reasons. For the registration of a user account, for example, the provision of a valid email address is essential and in order to complete a payment transaction, the necessary information must be provided.\nFor this reason, failure to provide the necessary data may mean that we are unable to provide certain services. Equally certain rights may be exercised in individual cases which mean that we are unable to provide our services to the contractually agreed extent. Should this occur, we will inform the person in question of the consequences in each individual case.\n3. Special details regarding scope and purpose\nIn this section we explain comprehensively in which specific cases we process your data.\nThe data is processed directly by Gameforge within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. Should in individual cases personal data be processed by a different body, such as a company associated with us or a service provider, potentially in a third country (outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area), this will always proceed within the legal framework and on the basis of a contract with the respective third party which stipulates compliance with all relevant data protection regulations.\n3.1 Advertising on third-party sites and links to our website\nLike many other companies, we advertise our services on external websites. A typical example are banner adverts, which are displayed on third-party websites as a graphic advertising one of the online games we offer and linking to the corresponding Gameforge web page via a hyperlink. Our partners do not provide such advertisements free of charge. The success of the advertising campaign is decisive in calculating the partner\u2019s remuneration. In order to determine this, an ID is generated when a user clicks on the advertisement. This ID is then allocated to the user\u2019s account when they subsequently register for a Gameforge account. This enables us to determine the number of new users we have gained through the campaign in question. Finally, the advertising partner receives a complete overview of these registrations from us and issues us an invoice based on these. In some cases, partners also receive remuneration in the event that a customer completes a payment transaction. However, we do not pass on personal information about individual users to our advertising partners.\nWhen surfing external websites, the site operator may also set cookies (see 3.6) or create a device ID or a fingerprint (an individual value calculated from the sum of different characteristics of a user\u2019s system) that enable the respective provider to track the surfing behaviour of its visitors. We therefore recommend that you always read the data protection provisions of a page you visit carefully.\nGameforge has no interest in tracking the external surfing behaviour of its users. However, we have a legitimate interest in finding out from which websites or through which advertising campaigns our customers have found their way to us and which areas of Gameforge\u2019s services are of particular interest to users (see sections 3.5 and 3.7).\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in promoting Gameforge services and the evaluation and billing of our advertising campaigns.\n3.2 Visiting our web pages without registering\nTo the greatest possible extent, the Gameforge web pages can be visited anonymously to gain information about our online games. Registering on the website is only necessary if you wish to use functions that require a Gameforge account. For example, participation in our games or forums is only possible once you register and log into your new Gameforge account. Irrespective of this, personal data may be collected and processed by us without registration in the following instances.\n3.2.2 Server logs\nIn using Gameforge services, server logs are created (see 2.2 and 3.13) which log certain connection and usage activities.\nFor example, page views, times of access, the registration of a user account and the IP address allocated to your internet connection are recorded for the purposes of identifying and preventing cyberattacks or attempted manipulation, as well as for statistical analysis and the improvement of Gameforge services. Where necessary, other technical details such as the MAC address (the network address of your network adapter) or similar identifying features may be recorded.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the smooth and secure operation of the Gameforge services as well as their optimisation.\n3.2.3 Downloads\nWe offer various download options on the Gameforge websites and in connection with other Gameforge services. For example, you may download the contents of this Privacy Policy or download client software necessary for using an online game to your hard drive via your browser. Updates for our online games can also be obtained via the client software or the launcher.\nFor this purpose, a connection is made between your system and our download servers. The time of the download, the file downloaded and your IP address and other hardware specifications may be recorded for technical reasons, and for the purposes of IT security and optimising Gameforge services.\nThis data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company\u2019s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the initiation and performance of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.3 Communication with Gameforge\nOur community is welcome to contact us for all general questions relating to Gameforge and Gameforge services. We are also happy to answer questions relating to this Privacy Policy and data protection at Gameforge. There are a number of ways you can contact us. Certain personal data will be recorded when using one of these channels.\nIn processing this data when you contact us, we exercise our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) for the purposes of remaining in contact with you, potential contract partners and others who may contact us. In as far as a message aims at the conclusion of a contract between us and the enquiring person, or for clarifying contractual issues, processing this data may serve as the basis for initiating, executing or terminating a corresponding contract (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)). In individual cases this may be necessary to fulfil a legal obligation we are subject to (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)).\n3.3.1 Contacting us by email\nWe receive the sender\u2019s email and IP address and the contents of the message when an email is sent to us.\n3.3.2 Contacting us by fax\nWhen contacted by fax, we receive the sender\u2019s fax number, in addition to the contents of the message.\n3.3.3 Contacting us by post\nYou can of course also contact us by post. In this case we receive the contents of the message and the postal address provided by the sender.\n3.3.4 Contacting us via our support department\nWe provide our users support as described in 3.4.4. When using this Gameforge service, the email address, the IP address, the contents of the messages and such data that arises during the general use of Gameforge web pages are collected.\n3.3.5 Contacting us via social networks\nWe also have a presence on social networks such as Facebook and other external platforms. It is generally possible to contact us via the channels provided there (e.g. private messages or wall postings). In so doing we receive the information which is typically visible when using such messages (e.g. the username used on the social network). We recommend that you read the privacy policy and terms of use of the relevant platform before using this contact method.\n3.4. Registering and using a Gameforge account\nWhen using Gameforge services, you can create personal user accounts in accordance with our Standard Terms of Use and the relevant rules of the game. Such Gameforge accounts can be registered for individual Gameforge services such as game pages, forums, support or online games. In the future, it may also be possible to create a central Gameforge account for all Gameforge services.\nThe respective Gameforge services serve different purposes. Depending on the Gameforge service used, different personal data is therefore processed as a result of registering and using a Gameforge account.\n3.4.1 Registering and using an account for our game pages and optional payment processes\nThe purpose of the game pages is first of all to provide information about the corresponding online game.\nAs a rule, contracts of use are also concluded between you and us and the subsequent use and management of your Gameforge account is made possible. As part of the registration process, we create a Gameforge account for you with the data you provide and the data we generate, such as an account ID, and record the time of registration. At the end of the process you will receive a message from us to the email address you have provided confirming the registration of your Gameforge account. In addition to the summary of your basic information, this message may contain an activation link that you can use to confirm your email address. This confirmation, the IP address assigned to you and the confirmation time will be stored by us for verification purposes.\nIn this way, we will also send you contract-related notifications such as confirmation of changes to your password or the email address provided, as well as information about changes to your contract status.\nWhen using the game pages, basic information, usage and (when carrying out an optional payment process) billing data are processed. By basic information we mean the registration information of the Gameforge account, such as its pseudonym, the email address provided, the account IDs and, if applicable, character IDs or comparable characteristics, as well as the time of registration and the encrypted password selected by the user. Usage data comprises information that arises in the context of the actual use of a Gameforge service. This includes the IP address, time of use and the Gameforge pages visited. We use this information to identify suspicious logins and to process your requests for support. We also use this data to ensure compliance with our terms of use and, for example, to detect and prevent inadmissible multiple registrations.\nLikewise, payment transactions and thus contracts for the paid acquisition of virtual articles and for the arrangement of fee-based memberships can be concluded via the game pages. To confirm your orders and the respective contract, we will send you a corresponding message to the email address you have provided. When carrying out these optional payment transactions, we work with carefully selected payment service providers to offer you a wide range of common and convenient payment methods. When you carry out such a transaction, billing data is generated. This includes, for example, the IP address and the time of a payment transaction, the premium currency and the quantity ordered. The chosen payment method and associated details such as shortened credit card numbers (when paying by credit card) or encrypted telephone numbers (for telecommunications-based payments in connection with a landline or mobile phone) as well as an individual payment ID are also recorded and stored. This data can also be used by us to detect irregularities and to prevent attempts at fraud. In order to complete a payment transaction, it is also necessary for us to transmit the information required to allocate the transaction to the payment service provider. We may in turn receive additional information from the respective payment service providers, which we require and use solely for reasons related to tax law.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the provision of our services and the security of Gameforge services. In addition, the processing procedures described serve to initiate, perform and terminate contracts of use or contracts for the paid acquisition of virtual articles and for the arrangement of fee-based memberships (GDPR Article 6(1)(b))\n3.4.2 Registering and using an account for our online forums\nThe online forums can be an integral part of a game site or an independent Gameforge service. Our forums provide you with a discussion platform and enable exchange with other members of our community. Here publicly accessible forum profiles are created, which can be supplemented by voluntary additional information such as profile pictures, information on place of residence, occupation, gender or age.\nFurthermore, publicly available discussion posts and private messages to other forum users can be written. We recommend that you handle your data with care. Only share information with other users that you think is necessary. Keep this in mind especially with regard to sharing images or your contact details.\nIn addition to such content written by the users, a registered forum account may also be included in a publicly available list of members, which enables forum members to contact each other.\nWhen using the online forums, usage data such as the IP address is collected for technical, security and support reasons and individual data such as a user or contribution ID is generated and stored.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the provision of our services and the security of Gameforge services. In addition, the processing procedures described serve to initiate, perform and terminate contracts of use (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.4.3 Registering and using an account for our ticket support system\nIn addition to ticket support, you can also contact our support team with questions about Gameforge services and receive help in solving technical or game-related problems. Ticket support works similar to the online forums. However, the tickets written by a user and the answers received (content data) can only be viewed by the user and members of the support team, as well as Gameforge employees whose task it is to process such tickets. A Gameforge account is also required to use ticket support. During registration, information about the registration process is collected, such as the time of registration and the IP address assigned to it. In addition to a user and ticket ID, the contents of the tickets are also stored.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in providing and optimising our services. In addition, these processing procedures serve to fulfil the contract of use (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.4.4 Registering and using an account for our online games\nOur online games are a central component of Gameforge services. In comparison to other Gameforge services, the majority of data is collected, stored and processed through the use of our games. However, only some of this is personal data. It is also possible to use our online games using a pseudonym. In this case therefore, we generally do not know the identity of the users.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned basic information and usage data, content data is also processed in connection with the online games. This includes chat messages and in-game messages written by users.\nUsage data also includes certain non-technical information about individual game scores, such as completed payment transactions and shop actions, the respective game time, number of logins, character level and level upgrades or information about rule violations, which is automatically collected by our system. In contrast, non-personal technical data such as item IDs, map coordinates and similar game-related information, which is categorised as confidential information protected as part of our trade secrets, is also processed automatically.\nWe use basic information, content and usage data to determine the popularity of game content and game functions such as shop items, to process your support requests, to check compliance with the terms of use and rules of the game and to detect and sanction any potential illegal actions in an appropriate manner. As in all comparable cases, this includes contacting you by email, issuing a warning and restricting certain functions or terminating the relevant user contract in the event of a corresponding violation. In serious cases, we may also use the relevant data to assert or defend legal claims.\nIn our browser games in particular, special game functions are possible, such as publicly accessible high scores and overviews, which highlight special game performances and make sanctioned rule violations transparent for all users, showing the misconduct that caused the sanction.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the provision of our services and the security of Gameforge services. In addition, the processing procedures described serve to perform and terminate contracts of use or contracts for the paid acquisition of virtual articles and for the arrangement of fee-based memberships (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.4.5 Needs-optimised design of Gameforge services\nIn order to provide you with a convenient user experience, we can tailor Gameforge services to your needs. For example, we can submit individual offers to you and place associated advertisements, or we can configure the arrangement and graphic design of control elements of Gameforge services in such a way that is optimised for you.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the provision of our services in the most agreeable manner for you.\n3.5 Coverage analysis, tracking and analysis\nAs described in 3.1, we have no interest in monitoring the surfing behaviour of our page visitors, nor do we track what you do on the internet after using Gameforge services.\nHowever, we have a justified interest in the optimisation, further development and demand-oriented design of our services and in being able to better assess the benefits of our advertising measures and to remunerate them in accordance with contractual obligations. This includes information regarding how Gameforge services are used and from which external pages users find their way to us. We also want to learn about which pages are viewed, how often, how long the page takes to display in your browser and how much time is spent viewing a page, so that we can identify errors and further improve Gameforge services.\nThe Gameforge web pages also use a variety of cookies for these purposes, explained in more detail in section 3.6.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the optimisation and smooth operation of Gameforge services and fulfilling the contracts with our partners.\nIn order to optimise Gameforge services and especially the online games for a better user experience, we would like to understand how our services are used and whether optimisations and new functions are successfully accepted.\nFor example, to determine if a new quest is in need of optimisation, we could measure how many users have already accepted this quest and within what time it was completed, or which quest phases took longer to complete. We can also test which item description for shop items leads to greater popularity among users. Similarly, the number of clicks on a link to an information page and the length of time spent on that page can help us determine whether the website in question is necessary or needs to be improved.\nAs a rule, the relevant information is aggregated so that we can extrapolate results from the collection of individual data points, which in most cases cannot be traced back to individual users.\nWhen information is not aggregated, your data is generally processed in a pseudonymised form. In certain cases, we may display personalised offers, i.e. adapted to the needs of the individual user, based on individual usage behaviour. It is possible, for example, to offer appropriate equipment items to a user who prefers PvP combat or to hide less interesting quests for a user who prefers a particular type of quest.\n3.6 Cookies\nGameforge websites make use of cookies. The Gameforge sites use a cookie banner, which informs you about our use of cookies when visiting our internet pages, and links to our Cookie Policy which contains further information about our cookies.\nWhen you open Gameforge web pages in your browser, cookies are saved to your system for their respective lifespans. They are not executable applications and do not contain any elements that can cause damage; instead they hold a sequence of characters relevant to their function. Simply put, cookies are small text files in which information in connection to the opened website is saved.\nIt is through this that certain functions on Gameforge web pages are made possible. Cookies allow your browser to be recognised when revisiting the site, for example. This makes it easier and more secure to log into a Gameforge account, and allows settings you choose, such as the display language or screen size and orientation in a browser game, to be loaded automatically. Cookies enable us to present Gameforge websites to you in a functional and user-friendly format and in a manner that suits your requirements.\nAlongside these technically-required and useful functions (necessary cookies and functionality cookies), cookies also enable us to collect and analyse data regarding the use of Gameforge\u2019s sites (analysis cookies). This allows us to see how frequently a Gameforge web page is visited, how often specific page functions are used, or whether and at what stage errors occur (performance cookies).\nCookies are also used to deliver interest-targeted advertisements (advertising cookies). The information associated with Gameforge cookies is generally saved in a pseudonymised form however, which prevents us from linking it directly to an individual user without the enlistment of further information.\nIn addition to our cookies (first-party cookies), cookies from third-party providers (third-party cookies) may also be set. For more information regarding these cookies, we recommend you read the data protection policies of their respective providers.\nCookies will be automatically removed from your system regularly, once you leave Gameforge websites or if you end your session by logging out (session cookies). Some cookies may, however, remain stored on your system. To prevent this, you can change your browser settings to block all cookies, permit only specific cookies, or delete all stored cookies completely when the browser is closed. If you wish to make use of these settings, please follow the respective directions provided by your browser. Please note, however, that for technical reasons visiting the Gameforge web pages with such settings may make them partially or wholly inoperable, or otherwise limit the service provided.\nIn as far as personal data is processed by cookies, this activity is carried out in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in offering and optimising our services. With regard to the remaining cookies and the associated processing, this is done on the basis of your consent, which can be revoked at any time free of charge, which can be provided to us or revoked by making a corresponding selection in our cookie manager (GDPR Article 6(1)(a)).\n3.7 Online advertising and customer communication\nIn order to further increase the awareness of our online games and thereby win new customers or win back former users, we carry out various online-based advertising.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the advertising of our services.\n3.7.1 Advertising on Gameforge websites\nWe can display advertisements in selected areas of the Gameforge web pages. As described in 3.1, when a user clicks on these ads and then subsequently registers a Gameforge account, an ID is transferred. This enables us to determine the benefits of internal advertisements and optimise our advertising measures.\n3.7.2. Email newsletter and recommendations via email\nWhen registering a Gameforge account and concluding a corresponding user agreement, you must provide your email address. We do not only send contract-related messages to this address, but also information about Gameforge, new online games in our portfolio or adjustments to existing Gameforge services at regular intervals. In order to send you a suitable newsletter, we also use information such as the online game you are using and the account name you have chosen. In aggregated form, we record how often our newsletter has been read and which links contained therein have been opened. This information cannot be used to identify individual users.\nWe only use Gameforge email addresses such as gameforge@news.gameforge.com. For security reasons, always check incoming emails to see whether we have sent the message in question. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact our support department.\nIf you do not wish to receive such a newsletter, you can object to the use of your email address for these purposes by clicking on a link contained in each of our newsletters. You do not incur any costs for cancelling the newsletter. This does not apply to any amounts invoiced to you by your internet provider. Further information on your right to object can also be found in section 6.5.\nThe use of your email address for the purpose of sending the newsletter, and sending the email itself, takes place on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR and Section 7(3) of the Act Against Unfair Competition.\nFurthermore, Gameforge services can make it easier for you to recommend the respective service by copying a text provided by us to your clipboard which you can customise and paste into the email program of your choice. You can then enter the address of the recipient you have selected and send the message to them. We do not collect your email address or that of the recipient.\n3.7.3 External advertisements\nWe book various advertising media on external websites such as blogs, games, video portals and social networks. These can include, for example, graphic advertisements, advertising texts or videos, which feature a link to a Gameforge page. By clicking this link you will usually be redirected to a landing page, which can be provided by us or a hosting provider. As described under 3.1, the origin of the page view can be determined to evaluate the success of an advertising campaign and its remuneration.\nOur ads can be personalised. Following the entry of a Gameforge-related search term or after calling up a Gameforge web page, you may encounter customised advertisements on external internet pages. This is made possible by the use of cookies and the transfer of pseudonymous identifiers, which were previously converted into hash values, to the respective external site operator. We do not receive any information about users\u2019 individual surfing behaviour.\n3.8 Conducting surveys\nIn order to improve our services, we conduct surveys at various intervals. We use survey tools that are implemented on our servers and as a rule allow voluntary participation in an anonymous form. If personal data is to be collected in individual cases, we draw attention to the voluntary nature of the information in question and to the specific intended use by means of additional data protection provisions.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in providing and optimising our services.\n3.9 Competitions\nFrom time to time we organise various forms of free competitions. Depending on the specific form of such a competition, the processing of participants\u2019 personal data is required for the purpose of checking eligibility, selecting the winners and subsequently sending the prizes. Our terms and conditions for participation in the competition therefore contain additional data protection information.\nHosting competitions serves the pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in creating ties to our community. In addition, the processing procedures described serve to perform a possible contract with the participants and winners of the respective competition (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.10 Integration of external services and plug-ins\nTo extend the scope of functions and optimise user comfort in some areas on the Gameforge web pages, we use third-party services and related plugins, which make the selected functions of these services available.\nFor example, we integrate single sign-on functions that enable you to log into a Gameforge account via your external user account with the respective third-party provider.\nWe also integrate plugins that allow you to play our trailers and gameplay videos without having to leave the Gameforge web pages.\nBy using the corresponding functions you connect to servers of the respective third-party provider. Personal data such as the IP address, the website currently being accessed and the time of use may be transmitted to the third-party provider. We therefore recommend that you read the data protection regulations of the third-party provider carefully before using the respective function.\nThis data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in providing our services.\n3.11 IT security measures\nGuaranteeing the security of Gameforge services at all times is an important matter to us. To this end we use standard hardware and software solutions for monitoring the security status of our systems in order to identify and defend against malicious activity such as DDoS attacks, malware or unauthorised login attempts and other attempted manipulation. In addition to such measures, we also review our server and system logs.\nExecuting our IT security measures constitutes pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) for the purposes of ensuring the availability of our services and the security and the effectiveness of protection of Gameforge services.\n3.12 Ensuring compliance with the Standard Terms of Use\nIn order to provide all users with a balanced, fair and proper gaming experience, we prohibit the use of hacks, bots, cheats and similar instruments and any other illegal activities such as insults, harassment and hate speech in our Standard Terms of Use and game rules. We do not tolerate any violations of the law and because such disruptive actions also massively impair the fun of the game and lead to considerable economic damage, we ensure compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and the rules of the game in an appropriate manner.\nEnsuring compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and the applicable rules serves the pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the provision of our services and the security of Gameforge services. In addition, the processing procedures described serve to perform and terminate contracts of use (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).\n3.12.1 Supervising the game and monitoring logs\nWe use manual controls to ensure compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and rules of the game. To this end, employees and members of the support team participate in our online games and online forums and take immediate action against rule violations. In addition, any reported anomalies are checked by viewing the log files and, if necessary, penalised.\n3.12.2 Software solutions\nAs it would be impossible to continuously supervise the numerous different Gameforge services and game servers as defined in 3.12.1 manually, we also use selected software solutions to detect and prevent violations of our Standard Terms of Use and the rules of the game.\nSuch software solutions serve exclusively for the detection and exclusion of cheats and hacks, irregular multiple logins as well as the detection and suppression of fraud attempts. To this end, we have implemented appropriate server and client-side protection measures.\nIf an additional application is installed on the user\u2019s system during the installation of client software, we will inform you of this in a transparent manner during the installation process. The installation can be aborted, which means that the relevant security application will not be installed. It is also possible to uninstall the respective application together with the game client at any time. However, for technical and economic reasons the use of the online game protected in this way cannot then be offered. Once it is successfully installed, the application runs together with the online game and checks the game-related processes and the integrity of the game files during runtime. No further search or monitoring of the system takes place. If an attempted rule violation is detected, it can either be logged and later sanctioned or immediately ended. This is connected with the Gameforge account used for the violation being deregistered and blocked according to the rules specified by us and generally leads to the termination of the relevant user contract. This may also include the detection and blocking of connected Gameforge accounts. The related processing of personal data such as the collection of IP addresses, hardware information and gaming activities, as well as account information, is generally carried out by us. If we commission an external service provider for this, it is done in accordance with the legal requirements and with strict respect for your rights. In addition, we point this out to you transparently during the installation of the relevant online game.\nWe also use server-side software solutions that detect inadmissible logins and fraud attempts on the Gameforge web pages and block them according to rules specified by us. If actions of this kind are detected, this can also lead to the blocking of the Gameforge account used and associated user accounts or to the blocking of certain functions as well as to the termination of the respective user contract. The commission of an external service provider is done in accordance with the legal requirements and with strict respect for your rights.\nIn addition, affected users are free to contact us at any time concerning a decision taken based on the protective measures. We will carefully examine the relevant details and inform you promptly of a final decision based on the respective facts and will justify this decision in a transparent manner.\n3.13 Processing for statistical purposes\nIn certain areas of Gameforge services we collect data such as the operating system and version, browser and version, IP address and other relevant system data. We use this data for statistical evaluations, in particular for the purpose of adapting Gameforge services to the users\u2019 needs. Where possible, the data is anonymised and aggregated; otherwise the data is pseudonymised. None of this information is disclosed to third parties.\nWe process this information for statistical purposes in line with our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) for the optimisation of our services.\n3.14 Improving Gameforge services\nIn many cases, personal data is processed for the purposes of improving Gameforge services, for identifying and correcting errors, improving security and improving usability.\nWe do so in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in terms of providing and optimising our services and the security of Gameforge services.\n3.15 Safeguarding other legal interests\nIn individual instances, we may process personal data to serve other legal interests, such as in cooperation with relevant authorities, or the enforcement, establishment or defence of legal claims.\nWe act here in line with our legal obligations (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)) or in line with our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) for the enforcement, establishment or defence of legal claims.\n3.16 No change of purpose\nIn order to ensure that the purposes stipulated in this Privacy Policy can be pursued sustainably, we reserve the right to change the way in which data is processed to conform to legal or company requirements, for example by optimising our data processing activities, or implementing new processes. This will always be done with the greatest attention and under strict adherence to the legal provisions. We do not intend to change these purposes in a way that is not compatible with the specified purposes without your express consent. In order to maintain the maximum transparency we are striving for, we will display and inform you of relevant adjustments in this Privacy Policy.\n3.17 Balance of interests\nIn as far as we process personal data on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, that being in pursuit of our legitimate interests, we firstly determine our interest in processing the data in question. This is then weighed against the expectable interests of the affected persons. This includes taking into consideration the desired purpose, the form of data processing and the associated risks to the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. At the same time we consider whether the technical and organisational measures taken are sufficient to meet the necessary level of protection. We only process data on this basis where this is the case, and the relevant data is limited to that which is indeed required.\n4. Forwarding and transferring personal data\nAs a rule, your data is only processed directly by us within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and always for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. This section details how and why personal data may in certain instances be forwarded or transferred.\n4.1 Reasons for forwarding and transferring personal data\nYour data will only be internally forwarded or externally transferred where necessary in achieving one of the aims outlined in this Privacy Policy. Any data forwarded or transferred is limited to the amount absolutely necessary.\n4.2 Internal and external recipients of personal data\nAs a rule, your data is passed on internally to the department responsible for the respective processing, which is then processed only by the employee(s) responsible. For example, we can forward a complaint received by post to the responsible support employee. Our employees are trained in the field of data protection, are bound by obligations of confidentiality and data privacy, and are committed by company guidelines and instructions to handle your data in accordance with legal requirements and the contents of this Privacy Policy.\nFor technical, legal or business reasons it may also be necessary in certain cases to pass your data on to third parties. For instance, it may be necessary that we forward your data to a company associated with us as per Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (currently Gameforge AG and Palado GmbH, both reachable at the address provided above) for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, our financial accounting, legal department and group data protection are organisationally affiliated to our parent company (Gameforge AG).\nFurthermore, carefully selected service companies make their data centres available to us for sending our newsletter and integrating payment methods. We also work with service providers who enable us to assess the success of an advertising campaign or support us in avoiding fraud attempts and breaches of the rules. Should it be required by law, we also forward data to the relevant authorities to the necessary extent. If we require external advice from third parties, in particular legal advice, for the purposes of enforcing or defending legal claims, we may also transfer the necessary data to these recipients.\nAny transfer is performed exclusively for the purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy with the greatest attention and under strict adherence to the legal provisions, in particular the conclusion of an agreement for processing data by contract as per Article 28(3) sentence 1 of the GDPR.\n4.3 Recipients in third countries\nBefore any personal data is transferred, we check thoroughly that all the legal requirements for the transfer in question are met for the particular case. For this reason, we only transfer data to recipients in third countries (see section 3) when this level of protection for personal data is provided in the country and we are convinced that the respective recipient will handle the received data in compliance with the data protection standard laid out this Privacy Policy. An adequate level of data protection can be expected, for example, where the European Commission has made a decision confirming the country in question meets the standards of data adequacy or the transfer is concluded on the basis of the European Commission\u2019s standard contractual clauses.\n5. Data retention\nIn this section, we explain how long we store the personal data we collect.\nWe do not retain personal data without purpose. The length of time data is retained is primarily linked to the basic purpose and necessity of storing it. Personal data is therefore only stored in as far as it is required for a specific purpose.\nWhen determining the retention period, we first check whether it is necessary to store the relevant data for the entire term of a contract with the persons concerned. This is particularly the case with basic information such as the registered email address. In individual cases, such as in the case of forum posts, storage may also take place in addition to this for information reasons.\nIf such permanent storage is not required, we will check the minimum storage period specifically required for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. Complaints and support requests, as well as usage data that may result in a rule violation, are stored until it is no longer necessary for asserting, enforcing or defending legal claims or for further support cases. Our standard is the regular statute of limitations of three years in accordance with Section 195 of the German Civil Code. If the data need only be saved for technical reasons for a short time (for example, during your current session), this data will only be stored for the period of use and a maximum of 30 days.\nFinally, we check whether any legal retention periods apply, particularly in terms of taxation law (Section 147(3) of the Fiscal Code of Germany) or commercial law (Section 257(4) of the German Commercial Code), which may for example require documents to be stored for a period of six to ten years.\nIf there is no cause to process the data, the data is no longer required for this purpose, and there are no legal requirements to store the data, we delete it.\n6. Your rights\nIn this section we inform you about the rights individuals have in regard to the processing of their data and how these rights can be exercised.\n6.1 Right of access\nYou have the right to demand confirmation from us regarding whether we are processing your data. If this is the case, you also have the right to demand comprehensive information, a free copy of the data and more information from us.\n6.2 Right to rectification\nShould the data relating to your person be incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to demand that the data be corrected or completed.\n6.3 Right to erasure\nYou have the basic right to demand the immediate deletion of your data. Legal reasons may however stand in the way of this, in particular the requirement to process the relevant data to fulfil the agreement with you or legal data retention requirements. In individual cases your data may also be required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In such instances we will process the affected data strictly in accordance with this purpose, followed by immediate deletion as soon as the relevant reasons for retention no longer apply. We will inform you in such instances accordingly.\n6.4 Right to restriction of processing\nAs an alternative to the deletion of your data, you have the basic right to demand restrictions in how we process your data. If you make use of this right, we are essentially restricted to storing the associated data. Processing the data in other ways is only permissible with your consent, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities.\n6.5 Right to object\nOn grounds relating to your situation, you have the right to object to the processing of personal data associated with you, in as far as the specific processing is pursuant to our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Should you have and exercise your right to object, we will no longer process the affected data.\nIn exceptional cases your right to object may not be exercised, where we have a compelling legitimate reason for processing the data which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. This exception does not apply, however, when you object to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes, including marketing-related profiling. You may exercise your right to object to these purposes at any time.\n6.6 Withdrawal of consent\nIf we are processing data on the basis of the consent you have provided, you can withdraw your consent effective for the future at any time. We will cease processing your data upon receiving withdrawal of your consent and until such time as your consent has been granted once more.\n6.7 Right to data portability\nIf we are processing your data with your consent, or for the purposes of justifying, executing or terminating a contract with you, you have the right to receive the data you have made available to us. The data is provided in a structured, accessible and machine-readable format. In exercising this right, you also have the right to request that your personal data be transferred directly to another controller, so far as this is technically feasible.\n6.8 Right to appeal\nYou have the right to appeal to a supervisory authority if you believe that your personal data is being processed by us in violation of the legal provisions.\n6.9 Exercising your rights\nYou are free to contact us in your preferred way to exercise your rights set out here (see section 1 for details). As we do not collect any plaintext data such as your name or address, and we can only establish your identification via the email address you have linked to your Gameforge account, we recommend that when registering for ticket support, you use the email address of your Gameforge account or link this address to your support account. This ensures that your issue can be dealt with quickly and in an uncomplicated manner. Inform the support team of your concern. Alternatively, you can contact our data protection officer in confidence using your email address. For an uncomplicated assignment, please explain the matter to us as precisely as possible in all cases. If possible, please indicate in particular the online game you are using, the language version, the game server and your account name.\n7. Data protection information\nIn handling personal data, we have made appropriate technical and organisational measures to maintain data security and reduce the risks to the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. This includes the fact that we do not collect any real names or addresses and that we maintain the respective Gameforge accounts using pseudonyms. We also limit the personal data collected and stored to the required minimum, and encrypt it where possible. This applies accordingly when providing and transferring personal data when registering and using a Gameforge account. During payment transactions, for example, your data is transferred in an encrypted form using SSL. Our SSL transfer is THAWTE-certified. Finally, all our employees are informed and trained to maintain data confidentiality and privacy obligations.\n8. Information on referrals to third-party services (hyperlinks)\nIn some places, Gameforge services contain links which redirect users to external websites. If you click on such a hyperlink, you will be redirected to services that are beyond our control and influence. The respective provider is solely responsible for these services. The data protection regulations of the relevant provider apply in each case.\n9. Version and changes to this Privacy Policy\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on 13th October 2020. We reserve the right to change its contents in order to correct mistakes, improve understandability, provide supplemental information, or for legal reasons. In cases where they are adjusted, the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy and the protection of your personal data will be preserved.\n"}]}, {"title": "mobile.de", "paragraphs": [{"qas":

You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under Rights as a data subject.\n6. International data transfers\nSome recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.\n6.1 Data transfers to eCG company group members\nmobile.de is part of the eCG group. As a rule, your personal data is processed exclusively within the European Union. If, by way of exception, personal data is transferred to companies of the eCG company group, this transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the EU Commission).\n6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)\nWe will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay. In other cases, mobile.de provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available on request.\n7. Storage duration and erasure\nYour personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.\nThe specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:\n- Necessity for the provision of our Services This includes such things as executing the contract with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.\n- Special categories of personal data If we store special categories of personal data (i.e. personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.\n- Consent-based processing of personal data If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.\n- Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.\n8. Rights as a data subject\nSubject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and object to our processing of your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests.

Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n- You have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal data concerning you, unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

For example, other users can see your ads, ratings and associated comments.\nYour responsibilities over personal data of other users that you receive through mobile.de When you communicate with another user and receive personal data (such as name, email address or other contact information) from the other user, you are, independent from us, the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you.\nUnless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\nYou may only use the personal data that you have access to for mobile.de transaction-related purposes, and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our General Terms and Conditions.\nPersonal data relating to third parties If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\nFiltering of messages sent via our messaging tools All messages sent via our messaging tools are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our General Terms and Conditions, we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to block your mobile.de account.\nThis is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our General Terms and Conditions and our other rules and policies (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content).\nAre you obliged to provide your personal data to us? Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the contract with you. Although the provision of any other personal data is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as item details and contact information when posting an ad.\nChildren's Privacy Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our General Terms and Conditions, children are not permitted to use our Services.\nStaying Signed in When you sign in to your account on our Services, you stay signed in for certain amount of time, until you log out. If you use our app, you stay signed in. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to log out at the end of your session. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:\n- Post an ad or contact another user\n- View your activities\n- View your mobile.de profile page\n- Search your saved cars and searches\n- Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving ratings or submitting claims\nIf you attempt to change your password or your user name, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.\nYou can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your mobile.de account and your personal data.\n12. Cross-channel advertising\nWhen you enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up to a newsletter or similar) we may share personal or other information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our partner LiveRamp, Inc. and its group companies (LiveRamp, Inc., 225 Bush Street, 17th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA).

If you feel that we have collected personal data of a minor without consent, please contact us via our privacy form. We will then proceed to erase this data.\nAutomated decision-making and profiling\nIn the performance of the contract with you and to improve our platform, JET uses automated decision-making and profiling. For example, JET uses your address data and/or location data to select available restaurants in your local area. We also use automated decision-making in complying with our legal obligations to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and other criminal offences.\nWhen such automated decision-making and/or profiling leads to a negative decision about you, and you do not agree with it, you can contact us via our privacy form. We will then proceed to reassess the situation.\nHow long we store personal data for\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\nIn some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.\nIf you have any questions on the way we retain your personal data you can contact us via our privacy form.\nSharing with restaurants\nIf you order via our Services, JET will share your personal data (order, name, address data and telephone number) with the restaurant you selected, so that the restaurant can deliver your order. As you are a direct customer of the restaurant, the restaurant will have its own responsibility and obligations with respect to the processing of your personal data. If you have questions about how the restaurant handles your personal data, you should contact the restaurant directly.\nSharing data for JET for Business and JET for Business Card\nIf you use your JET for Business allowance to pay for an order you placed via our Services or by using JET for Business Card, JET shares personal data (such as email address and data about your order and allowance) with the person that grants you the allowance, (which might be your employer, business partner etc.) for performing our contract with this person. Please note that the person that grants you the allowance has its own responsibility and obligation with respect to the processing of your personal data. The person that grants you the allowance also shares personal data with us to allow us and the JET for Business card service providers to provide JET for Business and/or JET for Business Card services to you.\nSharing with others (not being restaurants)\nJET may work with other companies within the JET group and other third parties in order to carry out the processing described above and/or to comply with legal obligations.\nThese group companies and third parties will process your personal data on behalf of us (as data processors) or as autonomous data controllers, and have access to your personal data for the purposes described in this privacy notice. We require group companies and third parties to protect your personal data in accordance with the standards set out in this privacy notice and we take appropriate measures pursuant to the applicable data protection law to guarantee the same level of protection and confidentiality.\nWe will also share your data with other third party data controllers where appropriate or required by applicable law or regulation (including a court order) or where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, to exercise, establish or defend legal rights or to protect the vital interests of any person. Such third party controllers may include law enforcement agencies.\nWe may also disclose your data to any company or prospective buyer of all or substantially all of our assets in connection with any sale or transfer of those assets.\nYour personal data may be shared with the following parties:\n- JET\u2019s affiliates, subsidiaries and/or group companies of JET\n- Software providers\n- Implementation partners\n- Payment and card service providers\n- Customer satisfaction survey firms\n- Loyalty shop partners (see section 5)\n- Professional advisors\n- Law enforcement, regulatory bodies and/or government agencies\n- Prospective buyers\n- Any other third party provided that you have given your consent to the disclosure\nThird-party websites\nOur website may include links to third-party websites. When accessing such third-party websites, bear in mind that each of these websites has its own privacy statement. Although JET takes great care in selecting websites to link to, we cannot take responsibility for the way in which they handle your personal data.\nWhere your data gets sent\nWe may transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This may include transferring it to or accessing it from other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions that may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the EU data protection laws. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA we will take into account any applicable statutory obligations relevant to personal data transfers and, where there is no European Commission (EC) adequacy decision in place, we will rely on appropriate safeguards, including EC approved standard contractual clauses. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and further data can be provided upon request.\nPersonal data rights, questions or complaints\nWe inform you that, with regard to the personal data, you can exercise the rights provided for by applicable data protection laws, which include: the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing, and to object to processing, the right to data portability, to withdraw your consent at any time (without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given prior to the withdrawal) as well as to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\nTo exercise your rights please contact us via our privacy form.\nRegarding requests related to processing or sharing of personal data related to JET for Business and/or JET for Business Card, please contact the person that grants you the JET for Business allowance (which might be your employer, business partner etc.). This is required because JET and the person that grants you the allowance have a separate responsibility with respect to the processing of your personal data.\nIf you have any other questions or complaints about the processing of your personal data, we will be happy to talk to you. We would also like to hear from you if you have tips or suggestions on how to improve our privacy policy.\nSecurity\nJET takes personal data protection very seriously and we therefore take appropriate measures to protect your personal data against misuse, loss, unauthorised access, unwanted disclosure, and unauthorised alteration. If you feel that your personal data are not adequately protected or there are indications of misuse, please contact us via our privacy form.\nData Protection Authority\nBesides the option of lodging a complaint with us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority for the protection of personal data. To do so, contact the supervisory authority directly.\nHow to contact us\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement and/or our privacy practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer: via our privacy form or by contacting our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Council:\nJust Eat Takeaway.com Data Protection Officer/ Privacy Council - Takeaway.com Group B.V.\nOosterdoksstraat 80\n1011 DK Amsterdam\nNetherlands\nUpdates to this privacy Statement\nWe may update this privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

Typically, an account owner designates one or more people (called an \"administrator\") to manage their account and can grant privileges to users on the account. Depending on their license with Zoom, the account owner can authorize additional users on their account, and the account owner can create and/or access the profile information for all users on their account. The account owner and their users can invite others (including guests not on their account) to meetings or webinars hosted on their account.\n- Zoom gives account owners controls and features that they can use to determine whether certain types of content, such as recordings or out-of-meeting messages, can be created or sent, and what third-party apps can be used, for meetings and webinars hosted on their account. Depending on their settings, account owners and the people they designate can access personal data for people who join meetings and webinars on their account or send messages to users on their account. Specifically, account owners may have access to:\n-- Account Usage:\n--- Product Usage: Information about how people and their devices interact with their account, which may include who sent messages to their users in chat, email addresses, IP addresses, device information, and other information about who joined meetings or webinars on their account, whether users viewed or downloaded a recording, how long people participated in their meetings, the time a message was sent, information about Zoom Phone integrations, and other usage information and feedback metrics.\n--- Participant List: Information about the participants in a Zoom meeting, webinar, or chat, which may include name, display name, email address, phone number, and participant or user ID.\n-- Registration Information: Information provided during registration for a webinar, meeting, or recording hosted by the account.\n-- Zoom Chat Out-of-Meeting Messages: If enabled on their account, account owners can see information about who sent and received out-of-meeting messages to users on their account along with information about the message (for example, date and time, and number of participants). Depending on their settings, account owners also can see sender and receiver information, and other messaging data, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account, unless the account owner has enabled Advanced Chat Encryption.\n-- In-Meeting/Webinar Messages: Depending on their settings, account owners can see sender and receiver information, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account, in the following circumstances:\n--- Messages sent to Everyone in a meeting that is recorded\n--- Messages sent to panelists in a webinar that is recorded\n--- Direct messages if the account owner has enabled archiving\n-- Recordings: Account owners can watch the content of recordings of meetings and webinars hosted on their account. They can also view a transcript of meeting audio, if enabled.\n-- Polling, Q&A, and Feedback: Account owners can see information about who provided responses to their polls, Q&A, or post meeting or webinar feedback requests, including name and contact information, together with the responses or feedback, unless responses are submitted anonymously.\n- Meeting Hosts and Participants: Hosts and other participants in a meeting may be able to see your email, display name, and profile picture. Meeting hosts and participants can also see and (depending on the account owner\u2019s settings) record or save meeting content, audio transcripts, messages sent to Everyone or to them directly, and files, whiteboards, or other information shared during a meeting. Hosts may also be able to see responses to Q&A and polls generated during the meeting.\n- Webinar Panelists and Attendees: Only panelists may be visible to attendees during a webinar, but attendees who agree to unmute can be heard by other attendees. If an attendee agrees to become a panelist during a webinar, they may be visible to other attendees, depending on settings. Panelists and attendees may be able to see the name of a participant who asks a question during a Q&A, along with their question, unless the participant submits the question anonymously.\n- Livestreams: Meeting and webinar hosts can choose to livestream to a third-party site or service, which means anyone with access to the livestream will be able to see the meeting or webinar.\n- Third-Party Apps and Integrations:\n-- Account owners can choose to add third-party apps to their account and the Zoom Products they use, including via use of the Zoom App Marketplace, and they can also control whether their users can add and use specific third-party apps, including in meetings, webinars, and chats hosted on their account. Depending on their settings, account owners and their users and guests can share your personal data and content with third-party apps and integrations they approve, which may include all of the personal data available to account owners, hosts, and participants listed above, such as account information, profile and contact information, registration information, participants list, settings, content, product usage, and device information.\n-- Other participants in the meeting may be able to see the third-party app that you are using in a meeting, if the third-party app is receiving real-time features and information from the meeting.\n-- Third-party developers may also integrate or embed Zoom meetings into their website or app experiences or build versions of Zoom that enable access to Zoom Products from a third-party app.\n-- Personal information shared by account owners and users with third-party apps and integrations is collected and processed in accordance with the app developers\u2019 terms and privacy policies, not Zoom\u2019s.\nPrivacy Rights and Choices\nIf you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the UK, or a resident of California, please refer to the respective dedicated sections below.

Depending on the specific personal data concerned and the factual context, when Zoom processes personal data as a controller for individuals in regions such as the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, we rely on the following legal bases as applicable in your jurisdiction:\n- As necessary for our contract: When we enter into a contract directly with you, we process your personal data on the basis of our contract in order to prepare and enter into the contract, as well as to perform and manage our contract (i.e., providing Zoom Products, features and services to account owners, their users, and those they invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, and manage our relationship and contract, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration). If we do not process your personal data for these purposes, we may not be able to provide you with all Products, features, and services;\n- Consistent with specific revocable consents: We rely on your prior consent in order to utilize cookies to engage advertising and analytics partners to deliver tailored advertising and analysis of our website usage. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by visiting our cookie management tool, available Cookies Settings;\n- As necessary to comply with our legal obligations: We process your personal data to comply with the legal obligations to which we are subject for the purposes of compliance with EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us, and for responses to requests from, and other communications with, competent EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities. This includes detecting, investigating, preventing, and stopping fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity (\"fraud and abuse detection\") and compliance with privacy laws;\n- To protect your vital interests or those of others: We process certain personal data in order to protect vital interests for the purpose of detecting and preventing illicit activities that impact vital interests and public safety, including child sexual abuse material; and\n- As necessary for our (or others\u2019) legitimate interests, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, which require protection of personal data: We process your personal data based on such legitimate interests to (i) enter and perform the contract with the account\n- owner and/or reseller providing you with the Products (which includes billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration and support); (ii) develop, test, and improve our Products and troubleshoot products and features; (iii) ensure authentication, integrity, security, and safety of accounts, activity, and Products, including detect and prevent malicious conduct and violations of our terms and policies, prevent or investigate bad or unsafe experiences, and address security threats; (iv) send marketing communications, advertising, and promotions related to the Products; and (v) comply with non-EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us and respond to requests from, and other communications with, competent non-EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities, as well as meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments, protect our rights and property and the ones of our customers, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.\nInternational Data Transfers\nZoom operates globally, which means personal data may be transferred, stored (for example, in a data center), and processed outside of the country or region where it was initially collected where Zoom or its service providers have customers or facilities \u2013 including in countries where meeting participants or account owners hosting meetings or webinars that you participate in or receiving messages that you send are based.\nTherefore, by using Zoom Products or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States where we are established, as well as in other countries outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.

Where personal data of users in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK is being transferred to a recipient located in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK which has not been recognized as having an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that the transfer is governed by the European Commission\u2019s standard contractual clauses. Please contact us if you would like further information in that respect.\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\nUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California residents may have a right to:\n- Access the categories and specific pieces of personal data Zoom has collected, the categories of sources from which the personal data is collected, the business purpose(s) for collecting the personal data, and the categories of third parties with whom Zoom has shared personal data;\n- Delete personal data under certain circumstances; and\n- Opt out of the \"sale\" of personal data. We do not sell your personal data in the conventional sense. However, like many companies, we use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies about your online activity.

safe customer experience. With this Privacy Notice we want to tell you about what data we collect when you use our products and services, and how we use and handle this data. We will also tell you where to find out more about how your personal information is handled and what rights you have with respect to this information.\n\"Polar\" refers to Polar Electro Oy and its subsidiaries. Therefore, when you use Polar\u2019s services or products, your information may be used and handled by one or more of Polar\u2019s companies.\nContent:\nUsing Polar services in short\nHow we handle your personal information\nSecurity\nHow we handle sensitive personal information\nHandling of personal information and its transfer outside the EU\nStorage and accuracy of information\nYour rights\nCookies and third parties\nUsing customer data in marketing\nUsing customer data in research and development\nError logs\nTelemetry data logs\nUsers under the age of 13\nChanges to the Privacy Notice\nPolar Flow and Flow App\nPolar Flow for Coach\nPolar Beat\nSupport/Customer Care\nPolar.com\nAccount.polar.com\nWebstore and online payments\nPolar Retail and Distributor Webshops\nPolar Club\nPolar Team Solutions\nPolar GoFit\nPolar API/Polar Open AccessLink\nCookie Policy\nUsing Polar services in short\nWhen you use Polar services, we may collect your personal data. That data is used only to offer you the service in question, nothing else. Polar does not disclose, give or sell your data to anyone unless we are required to do so pursuant to a mandatory provision of law. We may use some of the data in research and development work to improve our services, but for such purposes data is cleared from identifiers to the maximum amount possible.\nPolar is a globally operating company with customers all over the world. For this reason, in most cases your data is transferred out of your home country. Your data is stored on Polar ecosystem servers which are located in the EU/EEA area. Your email address or your user ID may on rare occasions be transferred outside the EU/EEA to the servers of our service providers for automatic notification purposes or for error reporting purposes. Even in those cases, service providers do not have access to your data.\nWhen data is transferred it is done only for the purpose of providing the service. Your data is not disclosed or given to any third parties; it is still under Polar\u2019s control and under your ownership.\nHow we handle your personal information\nWhen you create a user account for Polar services, we ask for some personal information (for example your name, email address, gender and age). We need this information in order to provide you with a personalised experience with our services. For example, we use your age info to give you a more accurate calculation of burnt calories. If you give us false information about your gender, age, height or weight, our algorithms will not calculate correct results for you, and we therefore trust that all the information you give us to be accurate.\nWe may collect some information about you when you buy products from our webstore, use Polar\u2019s services, or contact our Customer Care . If you only subscribe to Polar\u2019s newsletter, the only information we ask for is your email address. We only process your personal information for the purposes listed in this Privacy Notice and for the service-specific purposes on which you can find more information by clicking on the links provided. You can also contact our Customer Care team for more information on the handing of personal information with regard to each service.\nWhen you use Polar products or services, Polar collects information about you and may combine that information with any other personal information Polar has collected about you for the same purpose. If we have collected information about you for other purposes, we do not combine these. In addition, we may use your personal information to ensure the proper functioning and safety of Polar products, to verify your identity, and to investigate frauds and other misuse of the products. We may also process your information as part of our research and product development activities \u2013 we\u2019re continuously developing new functionalities and improving existing ones.\nIf you use any of our fee-based services, we can save your payment card information with your permission to facilitate further payments. This information is saved in encrypted format in a third-party system. We select our service providers carefully and ensure that they meet the requirements for safe and reliable handling of information set for that sector. When processing payment information, we comply with applicable legislation and the terms and conditions set and monitored by payment service providers.\nIf you wish, you may also share information from Polar\u2019s services to systems or services offered by a third party, such as Facebook or Strava. Polar is not responsible for any information transferred elsewhere or for the accuracy of the information outside Polar\u2019s system. Each service provider\u2019s information security and privacy practices are applied to such information.\nSecurity\nThere are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the Internet or other technologies, and no system or technology is completely safe or \"tamper\"/\"hacker\"-proof. Polar uses appropriate technical and organisational security measures (such as encryption) and precautions to collect and process data and to prevent unauthorised access to and improper use of your personal data. If Polar sites support online transactions, they will use industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of these transactions. We use industry standard security measures, such as SSL authentication, to ensure that your credit card information, as well as other personal data submitted as part of the buying process, is appropriately safe from third-party interception.\nHow we handle sensitive personal information\nThe majority of Polar\u2019s services are based on data collected on our products. Some of the collected data (such as heart rate data) is such by nature that we must ask for your permission to collect or process it. This permission is requested separately for each service that processes data that requires specific permission.\nHandling of personal information and its transfer outside the EU\nPolar\u2019s services and products may be delivered using resources and servers located in various countries. The actual service data (your account details and the data coming from your Polar devices) is stored on servers located in the EU/EEA area; Ireland, Finland and Sweden, but in some monitoring and ancillary activities of the Polar ecosystem (for example, sending automatic messages) customer email address or ID may be transferred to a service provider server outside the EU.\nTherefore, your information may be processed outside the country that the service you are using is based in, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), where the standard of protection of privacy does not necessarily meet the requirements set by the European Commission (such as the U.S.).\nWhen you register for a service (for example, Polar Flow) which may require transfer of information to another country for processing, we request your permission for the transfer. If and when transferring information, we comply with all applicable laws to guarantee sufficient protection of your privacy. In general, when transferring your personal data outside of EU/EEA, we apply the terms of the agreements based on European Commission\u2019s standard contractual clauses.\nWhen data is transferred, the transfer is carried out only for the purpose of providing the service. Your data will not be disclosed or given to any third parties; it is still under Polar\u2019s control and under your ownership. You can see all Polar service providers and their locations here . For more information on the transfer of information and related security measures, see our FAQ section . You may also contact us using the contact information provided below.\nIn line with the principles mentioned above, your information may be transferred or access to it may be permitted to Polar\u2019s subcontractors (such as the supplier of our Customer Care system) that carry out tasks related to Polar\u2019s website, products and services. Our subcontractors are not authorised to use the personal information for any other purpose and Polar\u2019s subcontractors\u2019 services are always covered by a confidentiality clause.\nPolar never discloses any of your personal information without a separate permission from you, unless it is necessary for handling your order, carrying out your request, or managing our interactive customer programs. Information may, however, be disclosed if necessary because of law, a court order, or a regulation or request issued by authorities.\nFor statistical purposes, Polar may deliver collected anonymised statistical data on its customers, sales, traffic types, exercise information, and similar website information to reputable third parties. These statistics do not contain identifiable personal information.\nStorage and accuracy of information\nWe want to keep our database up-to-date and we regularly delete out-of-date and unnecessary personal information. We only store the information as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or required by law. You can find more information on the retention times in the service-specific sections. You may also contact us using the contact information provided below.\nIn most of Polar\u2019s services, you can manage your personal information yourself. We recommend that you check the accuracy of your information occasionally and correct it when necessary. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.\nYour rights\nYou always have the right to access your personal information . In most of the services, direct access is possible, and when necessary, our Customer Care can assist you and deliver a copy of the personal information we have of you. You have the right to know what information pertaining to you has been collected, what this information is used for, and the parties, if any, that it has been disclosed to. To verify your identity in order to carry out your request, we may have to ask for additional information.\nPolar is allowed to handle your personal information when the handling is based on a legitimate interest. We use this legal basis in some cases for our research and development activities as we constantly want to develop and improve our services. You have the right to object to the handling of your personal information for these purposes. However, your right to object is not absolute. This type of processing of data is vital for Polar to develop and offer you better features and up-to-date technical know-how.\nYou always have the right to prohibit direct marketing. If you have given your consent to receive marketing messages from Polar, you can stop receiving them by following the \"unsubscribe\" instructions within each email communication. If you have created a user account, you can do this directly via our service. Polar will not provide or share any mailing lists to third parties for promotional purposes. Emails related to services (to confirm a purchase, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the service you requested. Such emails also include notifications about changes to our Privacy Notice and Terms of Use.\nYou have the right to have any of your information corrected or deleted either by doing it directly yourself in Polar services or account.polar.com or by sending a request to our Customer Care . If you want to have your information deleted, we will delete your user credentials and all information and data pertaining to you. This includes data in all Polar services that you have used (e.g. Polar Flow and support services). The deleted data is not retrievable. After we have deleted your information, you can only use the service by creating a new user account. Some of your data, such as purchase data, will be retained for a certain period due to requirements of mandatory provisions of law.\nAccording to law, you have the right to refuse profiling and automated decision-making. We may do categorising of data when, for example, targeting marketing messages to you with your consent. However, that type of profiling has no significant effects on you, so it does not qualify as profiling as defined e.g. in the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU 2016/679 (GDPR). We also do not make any automated decisions about you or your behaviour. You can also request that the handling of your information be restricted , also when you have prohibited the handling of your information and the assessment of the legal basis for the handling of your information has not been completed.\nIn some of our services we request your consent. We request consent only in cases when it is necessary for offering the service. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The consent can be withdrawn within the service. Note that for some services, the withdrawal of consent prevents us from offering the service to you.\nYou have the right to receive your information from Polar\u2019s systems in a machine-readable format when handling of your information is based on your consent or on execution of an agreement. You can download your information directly on account.polar.com.\nThe right to data portability only applies to the data provided by you, not the derived data that you see in Polar Flow service that has undergone manipulation with Polar algorithms. You can read more about downloading data from the Privacy FAQ page.\nYou can also request the transfer of your information to a third party. Polar is not responsible for the third party\u2019s system\u2019s ability to process the information in the format that is used for the transfer.\nIf you suspect misuse of the information, you may submit a complaint to the data protection ombudsman or a similar authority. Contact details for data protection ombudsmen in various countries are available on our Privacy FAQ page.\nCookies and third parties\nPolar uses web and mobile tracking techniques and targeted advertising. When you access sites under the Polar.com domain, you will be asked to consent to cookies and other tracking methods. Should you provide us your consent these methods will be used to collect device and network information, track your use of our services and possibly provide targeted advertising to you in our other sites or through our advertising partners. The analytics data will also be used to improve our services. You can read more about Polar\u2019s use of cookies in our Cookie Policy .\nPolar uses tools provided by Google, Facebook (such as Pixel, Conversion API, Custom Audience API), LinkedIn and Criteo. Nevertheless, no Polar related personal data is shared with these service providers without your permission. Read more here: How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services , Data Policy (Facebook) , What is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? (Facebook) .\nPolar uses Google reCaptcha in our legitimate interest to prevent misuse of our services. Using reCaptcha is essential for Polar service security. reCaptcha\u2019s application programming interface (API) sends hardware and software information, including device and application data, back to Google for analysis. Google in turn uses the data analysis to fight spam and abuse. Read more in the Google privacy policy .\nSome internet browsers have a \"Do Not Track\" feature. When used, this feature sends a signal to the online service that the user does not wish to be tracked. Polar services do not respond to \"Do Not Track\" signals, but our site visitors always have the manual choice of not accepting any cookies during their visit.\nUsing customer data in marketing\nWhen you subscribe to a newsletter or register to Polar services, you are asked for your consent to receive marketing messages from Polar. If you give your consent you will receive messages from Polar which can be for example newsletters, information about new products and services or targeted advertisements in social media. Furthermore, you may be added to a custom audience on Facebook or you may receive targeted NPS (Net Promoter Score) questionnaires that are related to marketing and other material. We may target some material to certain user groups based on, for example, preferred sport or used device. Some material is targeted to certain geographical areas.\nYou can withdraw your marketing consent at any time either from the marketing messages you haveve received from Polar or from Polar services. Withdrawal of consent will clear your name from all Polar marketing lists it may be on.\nPolar doesn\u2019t sell or give customer data to any third parties for marketing purposes.\nUsing customer data in research and development\nSports science research is at the core of everything we do at Polar. We have an in-house Research Center comprising experts from biosignal technology, physiology, sports training, health and data science, and we carry out innovative studies related to wearable technologies, sports training, physical activity and sleep.\nDifferent types of research\nFor development purposes, in-house research is being done by Polar continuously to develop new technologies, products and services and to improve the existing ones. New algorithms are being developed and tested, and customer mass data is being used to, for example, find anomalies in the features or to find devices that may not work properly. These results are not shared outside the company or published. They only support the in-house development work.\nSome of the research is performed in co-operation with third-party research partners. The aim of research collaboration is to produce a scientific publication of the results and the actual research work is done according to an agreed research protocol and ethical requirements imposed on the study. In these studies, no customer data is given to the third-party research partners, but instead all data is processed within Polar and by a Polar research team. If any customer personal data is used in the research, customers are asked a separate informed consent to use their personal data for the specific research project.\nMarketing research aims at better understanding of user groups of Polar devices and services, how the devices are being used and what new they may want. Marketing research is being performed by using data from users who have given their consent for marketing. Marketing research results (trends in customer behaviour, favourite sports, etc.) may also be used when creating content for social media, for example Polar blog posts. To offer our customers the state-of-the-art knowledge in form of devices and services, we need data from our customers. The customer data used for research and development purposes is cleared from identifiers to the maximum amount possible.\nError logs\nTo offer the best possible service in the event of a problem, we store error data on our devices (\"Error log\"). When you synchronise your device with Polar\u2019s service, the Error log is copied onto our server and saved there for a period of two years at maximum.\nThe Error log is only used for error analysis and statistical purposes on the basis of our legitimate interest. It can be used for example when you contact our Customer Care about an error or crash on your device. The only personal identifier on the Error log is the device ID which is needed to link the log to the correct device.\nTelemetry logs\nSome Polar devices may collect telemetry data from the device. The legal basis for collecting telemetry data is our legitimate interest. Telemetry data includes data about the functions and status of the device such as battery life, statistical data about synchronisation, statistics about USB connections, display, OHR usage etc. The only personal identifier in the telemetry log is the Device ID. The data collected in the telemetry log is used in Polar development to improve the performance of Polar devices and to get a better understanding on the average use of the devices. Like the error log, the telemetry log may be used during repair or other error situation management by Customer Care. The telemetry logs are transmitted to Polar servers during synchronisation of data to the service. The Device ID is hashed (one way) so that there are no clear identifiers in the data that is being processed at Polar's end. The data is retained for 60 days before being automatically deleted. This data cannot be deleted on request, only via automation. If this feature is being applied in your device, you can choose to deny the transmission of telemetry logs at account.polar.com.\nUsers under 13 years of age\nOur policy is to request that customers under the age of 13 do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on Polar websites without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. For example, a user account for a Polar service can only be created for a user under 13 years of age with permission from a guardian.\nChanges to the Privacy Notice\nThis Privacy Notice was updated on 24 March 2021. You can view the previous versions here . We may occasionally make changes to this Privacy Notice, and we notify our customers about such changes by email or via our services. If you have any questions regarding Polar\u2019s services or products, you may contact our Customer Care . You can also find information about privacy in our Privacy FAQ . If you have any questions or feedback regarding Polar\u2019s privacy practices, you can contact us at privacy@polar.com .\nContact information:\nData controller:\nPolar Electro Oy\nProfessorintie 5\n90440 Kempele\nFINLAND\nData Protection Officer:\nprivacy@polar.com\nPolar Electro Oy\nPrivacy\nProfessorintie 5\n90440 Kempele\nFINLAND\nPolar Flow and Flow App\nPolar Flow is a free cloud-based fitness and training app and web service that helps you track your training, activity and sleep data as well as analyse your progress. It works together with your Polar product and acts as your automatic training diary: all your training, activity and sleep data syncs from your product to your Polar Flow account.\nBefore you can start using the service you must create a user account through a registration process. During the registration process we ask for your approval of the Terms of Use and consents to some mandatory processing activities. These processing activities are mandatory for a reason: they are necessary to provide you with the service. These consents are also asked in order to meet the requirements of laws of multiple jurisdictions related to protection of privacy. If you do not want to give one or more of the mandatory consents, unfortunately then we cannot offer you the service. With a few exceptions (sensors and some old devices), you have an option to use your device in stand-alone mode. Consents are not generic. By giving a specific consent you grant Polar a permission to handle your data exclusively for the specified purpose, nothing else.\nBefore registering for Polar Flow, you need to read the service\u2019s Terms of Use and Polar\u2019s Privacy Notice. You will be asked to approve the service\u2019s Terms of Use. By approving the Terms of Use, you enter into agreement with Polar. We will also ask you to indicate that you have read Polar\u2019s Privacy Notice.\nWe would like to keep you up to date on all our news, offers and updates, so we will also ask for consent for marketing messages. Refusal is always the default setting for this request. You can change your selections anytime from your account settings. Read more about how we use your data in marketing here .\nWe ask for your consent for the handling of your personal information. This information is the data you give during registration: email, name, age, height, sex, training background and location. This data is used to provide you with accurate personal calculations such as calories burnt and Training Benefit feedback. You do not need to give your real name, but the name you give is the one shown if you share your exercises or comment on any of our communities. We use your location information mainly to identify your language. Location information is also used to direct your Customer Care requests to the correct Customer Care location so that you will receive support with correct language. Your email address is your account name and we may use your email to identify you later if you contact our Customer Care. For this purpose, please use an email address that you have access to and that is operational (not an alias). We will also send all important notifications to that email. You can change your email address at any time, so you are not forever stuck with the email you provide to us during registration process.\nWe ask for your consent for the handling of sensitive personal data. In Polar\u2019s case, sensitive data is heart rate data, the data we receive from the device or sensor you use. The Polar Flow service is essentially based on this data, and without this data the service cannot be provided.\nWe also ask for your consent for the transfer of your data to a country other than your home country. Polar uses servers provided by third parties to produce the Polar Flow service, and these servers may be located either within the EU or outside of it.

During this 210-day period you can verify your email or have the verification email resent to you at any time.\nWhen you create a user account, your privacy settings are private by default and your information is not displayed to other users. If you wish, you may share information on Polar\u2019s services to third-party systems, such as Facebook or Strava. Polar is not responsible for customer shared data once it is transferred out of Polar\u2019s system, and we no longer have any influence on the data. You are responsible for managing the information you share or transfer out of the system, so read third party privacy statements carefully.\nAs Polar strives to continuously develop its services, the exercise data you save in the Polar Flow service may be used to realise Polar\u2019s legitimate interests in research and product development.

If you create a customer account in connection with placing an order, we store this data to assist with any further purchases.\nThe actual payment is made via a third-party payment system. Online payments are made directly by the customer using internet payment services provided by the payment system provider(s). Polar employees will not be involved at any point in accepting payments via this method.

With payments related to Polar Club and Polar Team Pro, we ask for your consent to store the credit card credentials.\nPolar stores some information, such as the IP address used by you, in its system for some time on the basis of legitimate interest in order to ensure the security of the service. The legal basis for processing your personal data in Polar Webstore or in connection with other online payments is performance of a contract.\nThe purchase information is stored for 10 years unless the local legislation requires longer storage.\nYou can contact our Customer Care for further information on the webstore\u2019s register.\nPolar Retail and Distributor Webshops\nPolar Retail and Distributor Webshops are platforms where Polar retailers and distributors can place their orders. To use the Polar Retail or Distributor Webshop, retailers and distributors will either receive account details from Polar or they can create one or several user accounts themselves. The only collected personal information is the retail or distributor contact person\u2019s name and email address associated with each user account.\nEach retailer and distributor can manage their own user accounts themselves in the Polar Retail or Distributor Webshop: this includes creating and disabling their user accounts. The legal basis for processing the above-mentioned personal data is performance of a contract.\nPolar Club\nPolar Club is a heart rate-based group fitness and exercise app that enables tracking and displaying club members' real-time performance data, such as heart rate, intensity and calories burnt, during an exercise class. The participants\u2019 workout summaries will automatically upload to Polar Flow where they can keep track of their progress and reach their goals. When a fitness club purchases Polar Club, it signs an agreement with Polar. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the club is the data controller. The club is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The club is also responsible for the accuracy of the users\u2019 information and data-related requests by individual users (such as requests to delete the information).\nInformation on the clubs that use the service is collected in the Polar Club register. A username is created for the administrator designated by the club (Club Admin). For this, the person\u2019s email address is saved in the system.\nInformation on exercise classes is stored on the club\u2019s iPad for a month. Other data saved on the device includes the participants\u2019 training-related data and an electronic ID code to identify the individuals, which can be used to connect the username used in the registration to the Flow database. With this ID code, participants\u2019 training data can be transferred to their personal Flow account. The club\u2019s staff cannot identify users on the basis of these ID codes. The instructor\u2019s ID data is also stored on the iPad. Participants\u2019 actual Flow usernames are not stored on the iPad. All the user information stored under the Flow username is located in the Flow service , and the club does not have access to these accounts. The Polar Flow service\u2019s data is saved on Polar\u2019s service provider\u2019s servers. These servers may be located either within the EU or outside it. Read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms here .\nCustomers may participate in exercise classes via their existing Flow account, by creating an account in conjunction with signing up for the class, or by signing up as a Visitor.\nCustomers with a Flow account:\nThe customer can sign up for a Club exercise class using an existing Flow account. Alternatively, the user can create a Flow account in conjunction with signing up. No personal information provided in connection with the creation of the Flow account is stored on the iPad. The only information stored on the iPad is the participants\u2019 electronic ID and exercise data. The exercise data of the customers who use their Flow account to sign up for the class is automatically transferred from the club\u2019s iPad to the Polar Flow service using the ID code.\nCustomers who sign up as a Visitor:\nCustomers may also sign up for Club exercise classes as a Visitor, in which case the participants provide a name they want to have displayed on the screen during the class, such as a nickname or any other ID (e.g. a word or a string of characters). No personal information is collected or saved. Participants who signed up as Visitors may store their exercise data after the class by creating a Flow account or using an existing Flow account.\nThe Polar Club solution also offers clubs and their customers a channel for discussing the exercise classes and other similar matters within the club\u2019s own community. The Community service can be found in Flow\u2019s Community - Clubs section. When participating in discussions in the service, the participants may share information related to them if they so wish. When necessary, the club is responsible for moderating the discussions.\nThe legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our Customer Care for further information on Polar Club\u2019s register.\nPolar Team Solutions\nPolar Team Pro\nPolar Team Pro is a player-monitoring solution for professional sports teams. It combines GPS and motion monitoring data with heart rate information. With Polar Team Pro, the coach can monitor the team\u2019s training session via an iPad (must be bought separately) without a base station or antenna. Training data can also be collected after training by syncing the Team Pro Sensors via Team Pro Dock. Monitoring of players\u2019 performance offers valuable and accurate information to assist the coaching team in its analysis work.\nWhen a team buys Polar Team Pro, it signs an agreement with Polar on the use of the service. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the team is the data controller. The team is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The team is also responsible for the accuracy of the information and data-related requests by individual players (such as requests to delete the information).\nPolar Team Pro collects data on the teams that use the service and their members. A username is created for the administrator designated by the team (Team Pro Admin). For this, the person\u2019s email address is saved in the system. We will send a message to verify the email address and to confirm that the account was created intentionally. The account must be verified within 30 days in order to use Polar Team Pro. The administrator creates a team in the system by adding the team members\u2019 information (such as the player number, name, and date of birth) in the Team Pro service. The data is saved on the server of Polar\u2019s service provider. Training data is saved on the team\u2019s iPad for two months at the most and transferred from there to the Team Pro service. Individual players\u2019 personal Polar Flow accounts can be connected to the Team Pro service, where the coach can view them. The individual Polar Flow accounts are located in the Polar Flow service from where the data is saved on Polar\u2019s service provider\u2019s servers. These servers may be located either within the EU or outside it. Read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms here .\nThe legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our Customer Care for further information on the Polar Team Pro register.\nPolar Team\nThe Polar Team app is a player monitoring solution that provides real-time heart rate data for indoor team sports with Polar heart rate sensors and an iPad (must be bought separately).\nPolar does not collect or store any personal information via Polar Team. All data is stored on the iPad.\nPolar Team Pro API\nPolar Team Pro API is an interface that allows Team Pro data to be transferred to a third-party system. Team Pro admin user may connect Team Pro service with a third-party platform to allow data to be transferred between the services. This data may include players\u2019 personal training data as well as data from team training sessions.\nPolar GoFit\nPolar GoFit is designed for students, teachers and school staff to enable them to view and measure the students\u2019 heart rates and physical activity levels and to perform physical ability measurements in schools. The Polar GoFit service consists of the Polar GoFit application, Polar GoFit website (www.polargofit.com), and Polar\u2019s heart rate and activity devices compatible with GoFit.\nWhen a school purchases GoFit, it enters into an agreement with Polar or its representative. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the school is the data controller. As the data controller, the school is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The school is also responsible for the accuracy of the students\u2019 information and data-related requests by individual students (such as requests to delete the information). The school is also responsible for requesting permission from the student or, in case of a minor, their guardians before adding a student to the service.\nInformation on the teachers and students who use the service is saved in the GoFit register. A username is created for a contact teacher designated by the school (and for any additional teachers). For this, the person\u2019s name and email address are saved in the system. The teacher adds the student's user profile information such as name, date of birth, height, weight, gender and class in the system after receiving permission from the guardians. All this data is needed for the system and the algorithms to work correctly. When using the system, Polar devices or sensors collect exercise data which is sent to the GoFit server. This data is used to calculate information such as burnt calories and activity. In some cases, the teacher has some choice on what data is visible to users. For example, calories can be hidden from the screen from both the GoFit application and web service, but they will be saved among other exercise data to the database. The teacher can also select whether to show a student's name or student ID on GoFit application. The student ID is decided by the school and can consist of numbers and letters. Students may also use their accounts independently to view their exercise data, for example.\nGoFit training data is stored on the service provider\u2019s servers. These servers are located either in the EU or the U.S. Read more about the transfer of data and related protective mechanisms here . When necessary and with permission from the student or, in case of a minor, their guardian, information may be shared to a third party within the school environment. When necessary, information may be shared to a third party for purposes agreed on separately.\nThe information is deleted from the GoFit system when the agreement between Polar and the school expires.\nThe legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our Customer Care team for further information on the Polar GoFit register.\nPolar API/Polar Open AccessLink\nPolar Open AccessLink is Polar\u2019s proprietary application programming interface (API) that provides a direct information sharing link between the Polar ecosystem and third-party data systems. With Polar Open AccessLink our customers may transfer data related to their personal info, training and physical activity from Polar devices and the Polar Flow system to a third-party system that appears on the list of available systems, such as other fitness and training apps. Polar customers may also transfer similar data from third-party systems to Polar devices and Polar Flow (this feature may not be available at the time this version of Privacy Notice becomes active).\nFor third party developers:\nTo third-party systems, Polar offers the Polar Open AccessLink interface and instructions that enable the third party to register its own application in the Polar system and to develop a feature for receiving data.\nThe developers use their Polar Flow usernames to log in to the Polar API/Polar Open AccessLink service. A new application is registered by providing information on the application and the company. Approval of Terms of Use is required. No personal information is collected during registration; instead, the application is linked to the Flow account used for the registration. Several applications can be linked to the same Flow account.\nUsers are responsible for linking the third-party services they want to use with their Polar Flow account. The information is retrieved by the third-party services or sent by Polar Electro when the user synchronises data to the Polar Flow service or when user transmits sensor data to third party. Polar is not responsible for data once it is transferred out of Polar\u2019s system and it no longer has any influence on the data. Users are responsible for managing the information they share or transfer out of the system.\nYou can contact our Customer Care for further information on the Polar Flow register.\n"}]}, {"title":

Last Revised August 12, 2021\nWe want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (\"Reddit,\" \"we\" or \"us\") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.\nWhat We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared)\nInformation You Provide to Us\nWe collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:\nAccount information\nIf you create a Reddit account, we may require you to provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn\u2019t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide other account information, like an email address, bio, or profile picture. We also store your user account preferences and settings.\nContent you submit\nWe collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, videos you broadcast via RPAN, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.\nActions you take\nWe collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.\nTransactional information\nIf you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Premium or Reddit Coins), we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle payment information.\nOther information\nYou may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nWhen you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:\nLog and usage data\nWe may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.\nInformation collected from cookies and similar technologies\nWe may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see Your Choices below.\nLocation information\nWe may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.\nOther Information\nWe may also use information from Apple's TrueDepth camera to provide enhanced functionality in the Reddit app camera if you choose to use it. Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time \u2014 we don't store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\nInformation Collected from Other Sources\nWe may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics below.\nLinked services\nIf you authorize or link a third-party service (e.g., an unofficial mobile app client) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. Information sharing with linked services is described later in this section.\nInformation collected from integrations\nWe also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a site that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit\u2019s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser\u2019s site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics below.\nInformation Collected by Third Parties\nEmbedded content\nReddit displays some linked content in-line on the Reddit services via \"embeds.\" For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don\u2019t have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.\nAudience measurement\nWe partner with audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen) to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.\nInformation Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers\nIf you use Reddit Ads (Reddit\u2019s self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com) we collect some additional information. To sign up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information about your company. If you purchase advertising services, you will need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.\nWe use information about you to:\n- Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;\n- Research and develop new services;\n- Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our other policies;\n- Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;\n- Provide customer service;\n- Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see Your Choices below);\n- Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;\n- Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; and\n- Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.\nMuch of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.\nWhen you submit content (including a post, comment, chat message, or RPAN broadcast) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other sites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator\u2019s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.\nYour Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, awards received, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Premium status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. You can also choose for your profile to include the content you upvote and downvote.\nWe offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).\nWe do not sell your personal information. However, in addition to the personal information that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share personal information in the following ways:\n- With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.\n- With linked services. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in Your Choices below.\n- With our service providers. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.\n- To comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests.\n- In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.\n- To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.\n- With our affiliates. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.\n- Aggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.\nHow We Protect Your Information\nWe take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.\nYou can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.\nWe store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.\nYour Choices\nYou have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.\nAccessing and Changing Your Information\nYou can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here.\nDeleting Your Account\nYou may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the Your Rights - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section below. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.\nControlling Linked Services\u2019 Access to Your Account\nYou can review the services you have permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting your account\u2019s Apps page (for third-party app authorizations) and the Connected Accounts section of your Account Settings (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected Twitter accounts).\nControlling the Use of Cookies\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our Cookie Notice.\nControlling Advertising and Analytics\nSome analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by Nielsen and Quantcast.\nWe also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences your account settings in the Reddit app, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser. You can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (\"Reset advertising ID\" and \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\") and iOS (\"Limit Ad Tracking\") devices. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.\nDo Not Track\nMost modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.\nControlling Promotional Communications\nYou may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.\nControlling Mobile Notifications\nWith your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.\nControlling Location Information\nYou can control how we use location information inferred from your IP address for content recommendation purposes via the Safety and Privacy settings on your account. If you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.\nYour Rights\nData Subject and Consumer Information Requests\nRequests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account\u2014including EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") consumer information requests\u2014can be submitted following the process described here.\nAll other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account. Other inquiries related to your privacy rights can be submitted here.\nBefore we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.\nInternational Data Transfers\nReddit, Inc. is based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.\nWhen we transfer the personal data of users in the EEA, UK and/or Switzerland, to Reddit, Inc., we rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such transfers or other transfer mechanisms deemed \u2018adequate\u2019 under applicable laws. In addition, Reddit adheres to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (\"Privacy Shield\") and complies with its framework and principles.\nPlease direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the point of contact listed in the Contact Us section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries.\nFor more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield site.\nAdditional Information for EEA Users\nUsers in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised using the information provided under Your Choices above or as described in the Your Rights - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section above. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.\nAs required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA only where we have a legal basis for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. We process your information on the following legal bases:\n- You have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose;\n- We need to process the information to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;\n- It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, enforcing our rules and policies, protecting our legal rights and interests, research and development, personalizing the Services, and marketing and promoting the Services; or\n- We need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations.\nAdditional Information for California Users\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:\n- Identifiers, like your Reddit username, email address, IP address, and cookie information.\n- Commercial information, including information about transactions you undertake with us.\n- Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as information about your activity on our Services and limited information about your activity on the services of advertisers who use our advertising technology.\n- Geolocation information based on your IP address, or more specific location information if you authorize your device to provide it to us.\n- Audiovisual information in pictures, audio, or video content submitted to Reddit.\n- Professional or employment-related information or demographic information, but only if you explicitly provide it to us, such as by applying for a job or filling out a survey.\n- Inferences we make based on other collected data, for purposes such as recommending content, advertising, and analytics.\nYou can find more information about (a) what we collect and sources of that information, (b) the business and commercial purposes for collecting that information, and (c) the categories of third parties with whom we share that information in the What We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared) section above.\nIf you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, including the right to request access to or deletion of your personal information, and information about our data practices, as well as the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights. These rights can be exercised as described in the Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section above.\nChildren\nChildren under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services.

THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nPersonal information is typically data that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. This includes information you provide to us, information which is collected about you automatically, and information we obtain from third parties. The definition of personal information depends on the applicable law based on your physical location. Only the definition that applies to your physical location will apply to you under this Privacy Policy.\nInformation you provide to us. To establish an account and access our Services, we'll ask you to provide us with some important information about yourself. This information is either required by law (e.g. to verify your identity), necessary to provide the requested services (e.g. you will need to provide your bank account number if you'd like to link that account to CB), or is relevant for certain specified purposes, described in greater detail below. As we add new features and Services, you may be asked to provide additional information.\nIf you choose not to share certain information with us, we may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you our Services. Any information you provide to us that is not required is voluntary.\nWe may collect the following types of information from you:\n- Personal Identification Information: Full name, date of birth, nationality, gender, signature, utility bills, photographs, phone number, home address, and/or email.\n- Formal Identification Information: Government issued identity document such as Passport, Driver's License, National Identity Card, State ID Card, Tax ID number, passport number, driver's license details, national identity card details, visa information, and/or any other information deemed necessary to comply with our legal obligations under financial or anti-money laundering laws.\n- Institutional Information: Employer Identification number (or comparable number issued by a government), proof of legal formation (e.g. Articles of Incorporation), personal identification information for all material beneficial owners.\n- Financial Information: Bank account information, payment card primary account number (PAN), transaction history, trading data, and/or tax identification.\n- Transaction Information: Information about the transactions you make on our Services, such as the name of the recipient, your name, the amount, and/or timestamp.\n- Employment Information: Office location, job title, and/or description of role.\n- Correspondence: Survey responses, information provided to our support team or user research team.\n- Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as call and video recordings.\nInformation we collect from you automatically.

This information helps us address customer support issues, improve the performance of our Sites and Services, provide you with a streamlined and personalized experience, and protect your account from fraud by detecting unauthorized access. Information collected automatically includes:\n- Online Identifiers: Geo location/tracking details, browser fingerprint, operating system, browser name and version, and/or personal IP addresses.\n- Usage Data: Authentication data, security questions, click-stream data, public social networking posts, and other data collected via cookies and similar technologies.

From time to time, we may obtain information about you from our affiliates or third party sources as required or permitted by applicable law. These sources may include:\n- Our Coinbase Family of Companies: Our \"family of companies\" is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership (\"Affiliates\"). In accordance with applicable law, we may obtain information about you from our Affiliates as a normal part of conducting business, if you link your various Coinbase accounts (e.g., Coinbase Wallet account or Coinbase Commerce account in order to convert cryptocurrency into fiat and make withdrawals into your bank account), so that we may offer our Affiliates\u2019 Services to you.\n- Public Databases, Credit Bureaus & ID Verification Partners: We obtain information about you from public databases and ID verification partners for purposes of verifying your identity in accordance with applicable law. ID verification partners like World-Check use a combination of government records and publicly available information about you to verify your identity. Such information may include your name, address, job role, public employment profile, credit history, status on any sanctions lists maintained by public authorities, and other relevant data. We obtain such information to comply with our legal obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws. In some cases, we may process additional data about you to assess risk and ensure our Services are not used fraudulently or for other illicit activities. In such instances, processing is necessary for us to continue to perform our contractual obligations with you and others. World-Check's Privacy Policy, available at https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/world-check-kyc-screening/privacy-statement/, describes its collection and use of personal data.\n- Blockchain Data: We may analyze public blockchain data to ensure parties utilizing our Services are not engaged in illegal or prohibited activity under our Terms, and to analyze transaction trends for research and development purposes.\n- Joint Marketing Partners & Resellers: For example, unless prohibited by applicable law, joint marketing partners or resellers may share information about you with us so that we can better understand which of our Services may be of interest to you.\n- Advertising Networks & Analytics Providers: We work with these providers to provide us with de-identified information about how you found our Sites and how you interact with the Sites and Services. This information may be collected prior to account creation. For more information on how you can manage collection of this data, please see our Cookie Policy.\n4. ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA\nAnonymization is a data processing technique that modifies personal information so that it cannot be associated with a specific individual. Except for this section, none of the other provisions of this Privacy Policy applies to anonymized or aggregated customer data (i.e. information about our customers that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual customer).\nCoinbase may use anonymized or aggregate customer data for any business purpose, including to better understand customer needs and behaviors, improve our Services, conduct business intelligence and marketing, and detect security threats. We may perform our own analytics on anonymized data or enable analytics provided by third parties.\nTypes of data we may anonymize include, transaction data, click-stream data, performance metrics, and fraud indicators.\n5. HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED\nOur primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We generally use personal information to create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our Services, content and advertising; and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may use this information in the following ways:\n1) To maintain legal and regulatory compliance\nMost of our core Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us to collect, use, and store your personal information in certain ways. For example, CB must identify and verify customers using our Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering laws across jurisdictions. This includes collection and storage of your photo identification. In addition, we use third parties to verify your identity by comparing the personal information you provide against third-party databases and public records. When you seek to link a bank account to your CB Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk as required under applicable law. If you do not provide personal information required by law, we will have to close your account.\n2) To enforce our terms in our user agreement and other agreements\nCB handles sensitive information, such as your identification and financial data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we actively monitor, investigate, prevent, and mitigate any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our agreements with third parties, and/or prevent and detect violations of our posted user agreement or agreements for other Services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with our Services. We may use any of your personal information collected for these purposes. The consequences of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of your account.\n3) To detect and prevent fraud and/or funds loss\nWe process your personal information in order to help detect, prevent, and mitigate fraud and abuse of our services and to protect you against account compromise or funds loss.\n4) To provide Coinbase's Services\nWe process your personal information to provide the Services to you. For example, when you want to store funds on our platform, we require certain information such as your identification, contact information, and payment information. We cannot provide you with Services without such information. Third parties such as identity verification services may also access and/or collect your personal information when providing identity verification and/or fraud prevention services.\n5) To provide Service communications\nWe send administrative or account-related information to you to keep you updated about our Services, inform you of relevant security issues or updates, or provide other transaction-related information. Without such communications, you may not be aware of important developments relating to your account that may affect how you can use our Services. You may not opt-out of receiving critical service communications, such as emails or mobile notifications sent for legal or security purposes.\n6) To provide customer service\nWe process your personal information when you contact us to resolve any questions, disputes, collect fees, or to troubleshoot problems. Without processing your personal information for such purposes, we cannot respond to your requests and ensure your uninterrupted use of the Services.\n7) To ensure quality control\nWe process your personal information for quality control and staff training to make sure we continue to provide you with accurate information. If we do not process personal information for quality control purposes, you may experience issues on the Services such as inaccurate transaction records or other interruptions.\n8) To ensure network and information security\nWe process your personal information in order to enhance security, monitor and verify identity or service access, combat spam or other malware or security risks and to comply with applicable security laws and regulations. The threat landscape on the internet is constantly evolving, which makes it more important than ever that we have accurate and up-to-date information about your use of our Services. Without processing your personal information, we may not be able to ensure the security of our Services.\n9) For research and development purposes\nWe process your personal information to better understand the way you use and interact with Coinbase's Services. In addition, we use such information to customize, measure, and improve Coinbase's Services and the content and layout of our website and applications, and to develop new services. Without such processing, we cannot ensure your continued enjoyment of our Services.\n10) To enhance your experience\nWe process your personal information to provide a personalized experience, and implement the preferences you request. For example, you may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties. Without such processing, we may not be able to ensure your continued enjoyment of part or all of our Services.\n11) To facilitate corporate acquisitions, mergers, or transactions\nWe may process any information regarding your account and use of our Services as is necessary in the context of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or other corporate transactions.\n12) To engage in marketing activities\nBased on your communication preferences, we may send you marketing communications (e.g. emails or mobile notifications) to inform you about our events or our partner events; to deliver targeted marketing; and to provide you with promotional offers. Our marketing will be conducted in accordance with your advertising marketing preferences and as permitted by applicable law.\n13) To protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors, our facilities and our property and other rights. If you visit one of our locations, to maintain security at such locations you may be photographed or videotaped.\n14) For any purpose that you provide your consent.\nWe will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to time, and as required under the applicable law, we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal information with third parties. In such instances, you may opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties, or allowing us to use your personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained your authorization. If you choose to limit the use of your personal information, certain features or CB Services may not be available to you.\n6. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION\nFor individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland (collectively \"EEA Residents'') at the time their personal information is collected, our legal bases for processing your information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") will depend on the personal information at issue, the specific context in the which the personal information is collected and the purposes for which it is used. We generally only process your data where we are legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), where processing is in our legitimate interests to operate our business and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have obtained your consent to do so. In some rare instances, we may need to process your personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. Below is a list of how CB uses your personal information, as described above in Section 5, with the corresponding legal bases for processing.

WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES\nWe take care to allow your personal information to be accessed only by those who require access to perform their tasks and duties, and to share only with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. CB will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. We will only share your information in the following circumstances:\n- With third party identity verification services in order to prevent fraud. This allows CB to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases. These service providers may create derivative data based on your personal information that can be used in connection with the provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services. For example:\n-- We may use Jumio Corporation or Jumio UK, Limited (collectively \"Jumio\") to verify your identity by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your government issued identity document. The information collected from your photo may include biometric data. Jumio's Privacy Policy, available at https://www.jumio.com/legal-information/privacy-policy/jumio-inc-privacy-policy-for-online-services/, describes its collection and use of personal information.\n-- For Germany users, we may use SolarisBank AG (\"Solarisbank\") to verify your identity through verification of identifiable personal information. The information collected from you may include biometric data. Solarisbank\u2019s Privacy Policy, available at https://www.solarisbank.com/en/privacy-policy/, describes its collection and use of personal information.\n-- We may use Sift Science, Inc. (\"Sift\") to detect and prevent fraudulent activity on your account in real time. Information shared with Sift is treated by Sift in accordance with its Privacy Policy, available at https://sift.com/service-privacy.\n-- If you are based in the US, CB may use Plaid, Inc. (\"Plaid\") to connect your Coinbase account with your bank account, verify your bank account and confirm your bank account balance prior to approving a transaction. Information shared with Plaid is treated by Plaid in accordance with its Privacy Policy, available at https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy.\n- With financial institutions with which we partner to process payments you have authorized.\n- With service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations. Our contracts require these service providers to only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us, and prohibit them from selling your information to anyone else. Examples of the types of service providers we may share personal information with (other than those mentioned above) include:\n-- Network infrastructure\n-- Cloud storage\n-- Payment processing\n-- Transaction monitoring\n-- Security\n-- Document repository services\n-- Customer support\n-- Internet (e.g. ISPs)\n-- Data analytics\n-- Information Technology\n-- Marketing\n- With companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policies.\n- With companies or other entities that purchase CB assets pursuant to a court-approved sale or where we are required to share your information pursuant to insolvency law in any applicable jurisdiction.\n- With our professional advisors who provide banking, legal, compliance, insurance, accounting, or other consulting services in order to complete third party financial, technical, compliance and legal audits of our operations or otherwise comply with our legal obligations.\n- With law enforcement, officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement or any other applicable policies.\n- We share personal information about you with our Affiliates as a normal part of conducting business and offering Services to you.\nWhere we believe it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of any person. If you establish a CB Account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a CB website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information will be subject to their privacy policies. For more information see the \"Third-Party Sites and Services\" section below.\n8. SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO COINBASE CARD USERS\nIf you sign up to use the Digital Currency backed debit card Service (the \"Coinbase Card\") provided by CB via the dedicated app for that Service (the \"Coinbase Card App\"), we will process your personal information in accordance with this Policy.\nIn order to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you, we have partnered with Paysafe Financial Services Limited and Paysafe Payment Solution Limited (collectively \"Paysafe\"). Paysafe is the issuer of the Coinbase Card and is a member of the Visa card scheme, which will be used to enable your Coinbase Card to operate as a normal debit card. When you sign up on the Coinbase Card App you agree to Paysafe's own terms and conditions and Privacy Policy (available at https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/privacy-policy/), and as a result Paysafe will be an independent data controller in relation to the personal information they collect and hold relating to you.\nWe may at times need to share some of your personal information that we control with Paysafe to enable us and Paysafe to provide you with the Coinbase Card Service. Where we do this, Paysafe will act as a data processor and only process your personal information to the extent necessary to enable us and Paysafe to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you.\n9. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION\nWe understand how important your privacy is, which is why CB maintains (and contractually requires third parties it shares your information with to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.\nWe may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers, in the US and elsewhere in the world where our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.\nFor example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by payment vendors like Worldpay, (UK) Limited, Worldpay Limited, or Worldpay AP Limited (collectively \"Worldpay\") in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to CB or Coinbase staff. For more information about how Worldpay stores and uses your information, please see Worldpay's Privacy Policy at https://www.worldpay.com/uk/worldpay-privacy-notice.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.\nFurthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact information provided in the \"How to contact us\" section below.\n10. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\nWe store your personal information securely throughout the life of your CB Account. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes. While retention requirements vary by jurisdiction, information about our typical retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are described below.\n- Personal information collected to comply with our legal obligations under financial or anti-money laundering laws may be retained after account closure for as long as required under such laws.\n- Contact Information such as your name, email address and telephone number for marketing purposes is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe. Thereafter we will add your details to our suppression list to ensure we do not inadvertently market to you.\n- Content that you post on our website such as support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may be kept after you close your account for audit and crime prevention purposes (e.g. to prevent a known fraudulent actor from opening a new account).\n- Recording of our telephone calls with you may be kept for a period of up to six years.\n- Information collected via technical means such as cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.\n11. THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES\nIf you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your CB Services, then information you have provided to CB may be shared with those third parties. A connection you authorize or enable between your CB account and a non-CB account, payment instrument, or platform is considered an \"account connection.\" Unless you provide further permissions, Coinbase will not authorize these third parties to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using CB Services. Please note that third parties you interact with may have their own privacy policies, and CB is not responsible for their operations or their use of data they collect. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as contact details, financial information, or location data, is governed by their privacy practices and Coinbase is not responsible for unauthorized third-party conduct. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.\nExamples of account connections include:\n- Merchants: If you use your CB account to conduct a transaction with a third party merchant, the merchant may provide data about you and your transaction to us.\n- Your Financial Services Providers: For example, if you send us funds from your bank account, your bank will provide us with identifying information in addition to information about your account in order to complete the transaction.\nInformation that we share with a third party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third party's privacy practices. Please review the privacy notice of any third party that will gain access to your personal information. Coinbase is not responsible for such third party conduct.\n12. CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION\nWe do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, CB will require the user to close his or her account and will not allow the user to continue using our Services. We will also take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our Services.\n13. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS\nTo facilitate our global operations, CB may transfer, store, and process your personal information within our Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world, including Ireland, Germany, Singapore, Japan, the UK, the US, the Philippines, and possibly other countries. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and will take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect the relevant personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We contractually obligate recipients of your personal information to agree to at least the same level of privacy safeguards as required under applicable data protection laws. By communicating electronically with CB, you acknowledge and agree to your personal information being processed in this way.\nIf you have a complaint about our privacy practices and our collection, use or disclosure of personal information please submit your request via our Support Portal.\nData transferred out of the EU\nWe rely primarily on the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively \"European Personal Information\"), to the extent the recipients of the European Personal Information are located in a country that the EU considers to not provide an adequate level of data protection. This includes transfers from our EU-based CB operating entities to our US-based operating entity, Coinbase, Inc. We may also rely on an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the party receiving the information, or derogations in specific situations.\nCoinbase, Inc. is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Before we share your information with any third party, Coinbase, Inc. will enter into a written agreement that the third party provides at least the same level of protection for the personal information as required under applicable data protection laws.\nCoinbase, Inc., also participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Under the Privacy Shield Framework, Coinbase, Inc. is subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov.\nEuropean data subjects with inquiries or complaints relating to our Privacy Shield certifications should first contact CB via our Support Portal or by emailing dpo@coinbase.com. If we are unable to resolve your complaint or dispute, you may refer your complaint to our designated independent dispute resolution mechanism, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (\"ICDR\"), operated by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). For more information and to file a complaint, you may contact the International Centre for Dispute Resolution by phone at +1.212.484.4181, or by visiting the website https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.\nIf your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-ntroduction.\n14. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES\nDepending on applicable law where you reside, you may be able to assert certain rights related to your personal information identified below. If any of the rights listed below are not provided under law for your operating entity or jurisdiction, CB has absolute discretion in providing you with those rights.\nYour rights to personal information are not absolute. Depending upon the applicable law, access to your rights under the applicable law may be denied: (a) when denial of access is required or authorized by law; (b) when granting access would have a negative impact on another's privacy; (c) to protect our rights and properties; (d) where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.\n- Access and portability. You may request that we provide you a copy of your personal information held by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to a potential fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. In certain circumstances, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another data controller.\n- Rectification of incomplete or inaccurate personal information. You may request us to rectify or update any of your personal information held by CB that is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or My Account tab.\n- Erasure. You may request to erase your personal information, subject to applicable law. If you close your CB Account, we will mark your account in our database as \"Closed,\" but will keep certain account information, including your request to erase, in our database for a period of time as described above. This is necessary to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account, and to comply with CB's legal obligations. However, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n- Withdraw consent. To the extent the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of CB's processing based on consent before your withdrawal.\n- Restriction of processing. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict or object to us processing or transferring your personal information under certain circumstances. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.\n- Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. CB relies on automated tools to help determine whether a transaction or a customer account presents a fraud or legal risk. In some jurisdictions, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.\n- Marketing communications. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from CB. Direct marketing includes any communications to you that are only based on advertising or promoting our products and services. We will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) based on our legitimate interests, as permitted by applicable law, or your consent. If you do not want us to send you marketing communications, please go to your account settings to opt-out or submit a request via our Support Portal.\n-- For users in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland: To the extent we can rely on legitimate interest under the applicable law, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you. We will contact you by electronic means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such communication. You may raise such objections with regard to initial or further processing for purposes of direct marketing, at any time and free of charge.\nHow to make a privacy request\nYou can make privacy rights requests relating to your personal information by going to your Privacy Rights Dashboard or, if you cannot access the Dashboard, by contacting us via our Support Portal. Our Privacy Rights Dashboard also allows you to set your communication preferences and make individual rights requests relating to your personal information. We strongly encourage you to make any individual rights requests through the Privacy Rights Dashboard because it ensures that you have been authenticated already (based on the KYC information you have provided to open your account and by providing the necessary login credentials and multi-factor authentication to access the account). Otherwise, when we receive an individual rights request via other intake methods, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request to protect your privacy and security.\nHow to lodge a complaint\nIf you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to first submit a request via our Support Portal so that we can try to resolve the issue or dispute informally. If that does not resolve your issue, you may contact the CB Data Protection Officer at dpo@coinbase.com.\nIf you reside in the EU, you can file a complaint with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution by phone at +1.212.484.4181, or by visiting the website http://info.adr.org/safeharbor, or your relevant data protection authority.\nIn the UK, the relevant data protection authority is Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF, 0303 123 1113, casework@ico.org.uk.\nIn Ireland, the relevant data protection authority is the Data Protection Commission, Canal House, Station Road, Portarlington, R32 AP23 Co. Laois; phone: +353 (0761) 104 800; LoCall: 1890 25 22 31; Fax: +353 57 868 4757; email: info@dataprotection.ie\n15. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\nIn addition to the rights provided for above, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding whether we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To the extent we share you personal information in this way, you may receive the following information:\n- the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; and\n- the names and addresses of third parties that received such information, or if the nature of their business cannot be determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.\nPursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), California residents have certain rights in relation to their personal information, subject to limited exceptions. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this California Privacy Rights section.

Please note that these rights are not absolute and in certain cases are subject to conditions or limitations as specified in the CCPA:\n- For personal information collected by us during the preceding 12 months preceding your request that is not otherwise subject to an exception, California residents have the right to access and delete their personal information. CB will not discriminate against those who exercise their rights. Specifically, if you exercise your rights, we will not deny you services, charge you different prices for services or provide you a different level or quality of services.\n- To the extent we sell your personal information to third parties, you also have the right to request that we disclose to you: (i) the categories of your personal information that we sold, and (ii) the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold. You have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information. CB does not sell your personal information in its ordinary course of business and will never sell your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent.\nShould CB engage in any of the activities listed in this section, your ability to exercise these rights will be made available to you in your account settings. You can exercise your rights by going to your Privacy Rights Dashboard or contacting us via our Support Portal so that we may consider your request.\nWe will need to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful login to your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. Although we try to limit the personal information collected in connection with a request to exercise your rights, certain requests may require us to obtain additional personal information from you. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the right to know and right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity.\nIf you are a California resident, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access or a request to delete on your behalf. To do so, you must: (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit such a request; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. Please note, we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We will respond to your authorized agent's request if they submit proof that they are registered with the California Secretary of State to be able to act on your behalf, or submit evidence you have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4121 to 4130. We may deny requests from authorized agents who do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf, or are unable to verify their identity.\nDo Not Track\nSome Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit \"Do Not Track\" or \"DNT\" signals. Since uniform standards for \"DNT\" signals have not been adopted, we do not currently process or respond to \"DNT\" signals.\n16.

If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s User.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.

Corporate Family Members\nAs set out above under \"Personal data from other sources\", we also receive access to personal data about you from other eBay Inc. corporate family members - opens in new window or tab. This enables us, in particular, to provide you, with your consent as legally required, with information about products and services, which we believe might interest you, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising by analysing your use of the services of other eBay Inc. corporate family members, in particular through the matching of certain data (e.g. cookie IDs). Furthermore, this allows us to better prevent, detect, mitigate and investigate fraud, security breaches and other prohibited or unlawful activities, including the assessment of corresponding risks. We will also grant access to personal data about you to other eBay Inc. corporate family members for the aforementioned purposes. To the extent that other eBay Inc. corporate family members have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this User Privacy Notice.\n5.7 Additional information regarding our payment services for sellers\nWith regard to our payment services for sellers in the EU, we additionally point out that eBay S.\u00e0 r.l. is subject to professional secrecy, which requires special transparency with regard to the processing and, in particular, the transmission of your personal data. We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that eBay S.\u00e0 r.l. may pass on your personal data to trustworthy third parties and business partners where necessary to provide our payment services for sellers, as described above in this Section 5 of the User Privacy Notice. This includes in particular the following third parties and business partners:\n- Other payment service providers, including financial institutions\n- Companies offering financial products, analyses and scoring (e.g. credit agencies or bureaus)\n- Authorities, agencies and other governmental bodies (e.g. to combat fraud)\n- Auditors and other professional advisors\nYou can request a complete list of all third party providers and business partners for our payment services for sellers in the EU by contacting us.\n5.8 Automated decision-making\nWe use technologies that are considered automated decision-making or profiling. We will not make any automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you unless such a decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract with you, we have obtained your consent, or we are required by applicable law to use such technology. You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under section 8. Rights as a data subject.\nInternational Data Transfers 6. International data transfers\nSome recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.\n6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc. corporate family members\nThe transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc. corporate family members (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU, 2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the eBay Privacy Centre - opens in new window or tab.\n6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)\nWe may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorised by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU, 2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available on request. We regularly reevaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law, e.g. from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the matter C-311/18.\nStorage duration and erasure 7. Storage duration and erasure\nYour personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defence against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.\nThe specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:\n- Necessity for the provision of our Services\n- This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.\n- Consent-based processing of personal data\n- If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.\n- Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations\n- Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.\nRights as a data subject 8. Rights as a data subject\nSubject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and object to our processing of your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests. You can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\nYour rights in detail:\n- You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\n- You have the right to obtain access to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, where possible the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data\u2019s source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to access may be limited by national law.\n- You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n- You have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.\n- You have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing your personal data to the extent that\n-- the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,\n-- the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,\n-- we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or\n-- you have objected to the processing.\n- You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller ('right to data portability').\n- You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the controller.\nIf your personal data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nExercising your rights and managing your settings\nYou can exercise your rights as a data subject via our Privacy Contact page - opens in new window or tab. In addition, you are of course free to contact the eBay Privacy Team or the controller who is responsible for the processing of your personal data at any time (for further information, see section 2. Controller above). You can find all necessary information and contact details - opens in new window or tab in our eBay Privacy Center - opens in new window or tab.\nThe exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g. right to access or erasure) is generally free of charge. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs), in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations, or refuse to process the application.\nManaging your communication preferences\nIf you would like to change your preferences regarding eBay communications (including marketing communications), you can do so at any time in My eBay under \"Communication Preferences\". If you do not wish to receive email marketing communications from us, you can also unsubscribe by clicking on the link in the email you received. For technical reasons, the implementation may take a few days. For information on how to manage your cookie and similar technology preferences, see the next section 9. Cookies & similar technologies.\nCookies & similar sechnologies 9. Cookies & similar technologies\nWhen you use our Services, we and selected third parties use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with a better, faster and safer user experience or to show you personalised advertising. Cookies are small text files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your device when you use the Services. You can find detailed information about the use of cookies and similar technologies and your choices in our User Cookie Notice.\nThe cookies and similar technologies used in connection with the Services have different functions:\n- They may be technically necessary for the provision of our Services\n- They help us optimise our Services technically (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)\n- They help us improve your user experience (e.g. saving font size and form data entered)\n- They allow us to show you more relevant advertisements\nWe use cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device only as long as your browser is active (session cookies), as well as cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device longer (persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies.\nYour choices regarding cookies\nPlease see our User Cookie Notice for more information and your choices with respect to cookies and similar technologies, or go directly to Advertising and related preferences (users in the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) or AdChoice - eBay Advertising Preferences (all other users) to manage your respective preferences.\nYou are also free to disable the use of cookies and similar technologies if this is supported by your device. You can manage your cookie settings in your browser or device settings.\nYou can find information about third-party cookies (and similar technologies) related to advertising and how to prevent their use on the following websites:\n- www.youronlinechoices.com - opens in new window or tab\n- www.aboutads.info/choices - opens in new window or tab (only available in English)\n- www.networkadvertising.org/choices - opens in new window or tab (only available in English)\nIf you decide not to allow third parties to process your personal data for advertising purposes via cookies (and similar technologies), this does not mean that we will not show you advertisements. It simply means that these advertisements will not be personalised for you using cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies.\nData security 10. Data security\nWe protect your personal data through technical and organisational security measures to minimise risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorised access and unauthorised disclosure and alteration. To this end we use firewalls and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centres and authorisation controls for data access. You can find further information on our data security in our Security Centre - opens in new window or tab.\n11. Other important information regarding data protection\nThis section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.\nWhat happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?\nOther users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, shopfronts, Feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.\nWhen you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\nTo help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and postage information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\nYour responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\nWhen you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, postage and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.\nUnless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\nYou may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as postage, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.\nPersonal data relating to third parties\nIf you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\nFiltering of messages sent via our messaging tools\nAll messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our User Agreement (including any of our rules and policies), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.\nThis is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing or other illegal activities) or enforcing our User Agreement and our other rules and policies (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay.\nAre you obliged to provide your personal data to us?\nSome of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.\nChildren's Privacy\nOur services are not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.\nStaying signed in\nWhen you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorisation. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:\n- Bid, buy or make an offer on an item\n- Check out or add items to your cart\n- Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)\n- View the activity header\n- View the My eBay page\n- View or edit the Watch List or order details\n- View the profile page\n- Send member-to-member messages\n- Conduct after-sale activities, such as leaving Feedback, cancelling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims\nIf you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.\nYou can typically end your signed-in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed-in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.\n12.

Sharing your personal data\nThis section sets out the categories of recipients of the personal data collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.\nPublicly available information\nThe following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service:\n- Your profile name\n- Your profile photo\n- Your public playlists\n- Who you follow on the Spotify Service\n- Who follows you on the Spotify Service (you can remove followers)\nPersonal data you may choose to share\nWe will only share the following personal data with those outlined in the table below:\n- where sharing of particular personal data is needed for the use of a Spotify Service feature, or a third party application, service or device, which you have chosen to use; or\n- if you otherwise grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g. by selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or by giving your consent\nCategories of recipients: Reason for sharing\nThird party applications, services and devices you connect to your Spotify Account: To connect your Spotify account, and/or allow you to use the Spotify Service in connection with third party applications, services or devices.\nExamples of such third party applications, services and devices include: social media applications, speaker devices, televisions, automotive platforms, or voice assistants, which interact with the Spotify Service.\nYou can see and remove many third party connections under \"Apps\" in your account.\nSupport community: To enable you to use the Spotify Support Community service.\nWhen you register for an account on the Spotify Support Community, we\u2019ll ask you to create a specific profile name. This will be publicly displayed to anyone who uses the Spotify Support Community. We\u2019ll also display any questions or comments you post.\nOther Spotify users: To share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users, including your \u2018Spotify Followers\u2019.\nFor example, under \"Social\" settings you can choose whether to share your recently played artists and your playlists on your profile.\nArtists and record labels: To receive news or promotional offers directly from artists, record labels or other partners.\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) for this purpose. You\u2019ll always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\nInformation we may share\nSee this table for details of who we share to and why.\nCategories of recipients: Reason for sharing\nService providers: So they can provide their services to Spotify.\nThese service providers may include those we hire to:\n- give customer support\n- operate the technical infrastructure we need to provide the Spotify Service\n- assist in protecting and securing our systems and services (e.g. Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA)\n- help market Spotify\u2019s (and our partners\u2019) products, services, events and promotions\nPayment processors: So they can process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\nAdvertising partners: So our ad partners can help us deliver more relevant advertising to you on the Spotify Service.\nFor example, our ad partners help us facilitate tailored advertising:\n- This is when we use third party information to tailor ads to be more relevant to you (also known as interest based advertising).\n- An example of a tailored ad is when an ad partner has information suggesting you like cars, which could enable us to show you ads about cars.\n- You can control tailored advertising in your account privacy settings under \"Tailored Ads\".\n- If you are \"opted out\" of Tailored Ads, you may still get advertising on ad-supported services (such as podcasts or the Free Service Option) based on your registration information and ads based on the content you are streaming on our Services. For example, if you are streaming a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor or if you are streaming a workout playlist, you may hear an ad for sports clothing.\nMarketing Partners: To promote Spotify with our partners. We share some personal data with these partners where necessary to:\n- enable you to participate in Spotify promotions, including trials or other bundled offers\n- to promote Spotify in media and advertising published on other online services\n- help us and our partners to measure the effectiveness of Spotify promotions\nExamples of partners include:\n- marketing or sponsorship partners\n- websites and mobile apps who sell us advertising space on their services\n- device, app and mobile partners who also offer Spotify promotions\nOur partners may also combine the personal data we share with them with other data they collect about you (e.g. your use of their services). We and our partners may use this information to present you with offers, promotions, or other marketing activities that we believe will be relevant to you.\nOther partner sharing: We may share personal data with partners to help us understand and improve the performance of our products and partnerships.\nYou can see and remove many partner connections under \"Apps\" in your account.\nAcademic researchers: For activities such as statistical analysis and academic study, but only in a pseudonymised format. Pseudonymised data is where your data is identified by a code rather than your name or other information that directly identifies you.\nOther Spotify group companies: Where we have offices, to carry out our daily business operations and so we can maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\nLaw enforcement and other authorities: When we believe in good faith it\u2019s necessary for us to do so, for example:\n- to comply with a legal obligation\n- to respond to a valid legal process (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena)\n- for our own or a third party\u2019s justifiable interest, relating to:\n-- national security\n-- law enforcement\n-- litigation (a court case)\n-- criminal investigation\n-- protecting someone\u2019s safety\n-- preventing death or imminent bodily harm.\nPurchasers of our business: Where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or possible buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure your personal data is kept confidential. We\u2019ll give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or a different privacy policy starts to apply.\n6. Data retention and deletion\nRetention\nWe keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:\n- maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service\n- making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings\n- complying with our legal obligations\n- resolving disputes\nDeletion\nIf you close or request that we close your account, we'll delete or anonymise your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless we're required to keep something or we still need to use it for a legally justifiable reason.\nHere are some examples of situations where we're legally allowed or required to keep some of your personal data:\n- if there's an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit or unresolved claim or dispute\n- for our legal, tax, audit and accounting obligations\n- for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain security.\n7. Transfer to other countries\nWhen carrying out the activities described in this Policy, Spotify shares your personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.\nWhenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:\n- make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law\n- help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU\nWe do this using a variety of protections, as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:\n- Standard Contractual Clauses (or an alternative legal tool) to require the third party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections\n- technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation\n- policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests\nYou can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.\n8. Keeping your personal data safe\nWe're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various safeguards including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.\nTo protect your user account, we encourage you to:\n- use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account\n- never share your password with anyone\n- limit access to your computer and browser\n- log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device\n- read more detail on protecting your account\nYou can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the \"Sign out everywhere\" function on your account page.\nIf other individuals have access to your Spotify account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account.\nIt's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.\n9. Children\nNote: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids, unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.\nThe Spotify Service has a minimum \"Age Limit\" in each country. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:\n- is under the age of 13 years\n- or, makes it illegal to process their personal data\n- or, requires parental consent to process their personal data\nWe do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.\nIf you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us.\nIf we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.\nWhen using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.\n10. Changes to this policy\nWe may occasionally make changes to this Policy.\nWhen we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.\n11. How to contact us\nFor any questions or concerns about this Policy, contact our Data Protection Officer any one of these ways:\n- Use our privacy contact form\n- Email privacy@spotify.com\n- Write to us at: Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53 Stockholm, Sweden\nYou can also visit our Privacy Center for more clarification of this Policy.\nSpotify AB is the data controller of personal data processed under this Policy.\n"}]}, {"title": "Dropbox", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"id":

Please contact your organization\u2019s Admin for details.\nDropbox Privacy Policy\nPosted: October 29, 2021\nEffective: January 14, 2022\nYou can see the previous Privacy Policy here.\nThanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (\"Services\"). For more information and details, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page.\nWhat & Why\nWe collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.\nAccount information. We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).\nYour Stuff. Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (\"Your Stuff\"), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.\nContacts. You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you, and your Dropbox Business team (collectively, \"Dropbox Business Team\"), if you\u2019re a Dropbox Business Team user, to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we\u2019ll store those contacts on our servers.\nUsage information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information.\nDevice information. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.\nCookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we\u2019ll respond to that signal as outlined here. We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Dropbox services. You can learn more about how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for advertising purposes, here.\nMarketing. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don\u2019t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.\nWe sometimes contact people who don\u2019t have a Dropbox account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by Dropbox, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.\nBases for processing your data. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent. For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our FAQ.\nFor more details on the categories of personal information that are included in the information above, please see our FAQ.\nWith Whom\nWe may share information as discussed below, but we won\u2019t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.\nOthers working for and with Dropbox. Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we\u2019ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information that we\u2019ve disclosed, please see our FAQ.\nOther Dropbox Companies. Dropbox shares infrastructure, systems, and technology with other Dropbox Companies to provide, improve, protect, and promote Dropbox Company Services. We process your information across the Dropbox Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For more information on Dropbox Companies, Dropbox Company Services, and how your data is used, please see our FAQ.\nOther users. Our Services are designed to help you collaborate with others. If you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, join a Dropbox Business Team, or collaborate with other Dropbox users, we may suggest you or your team as a potential collaborator to other users or teams. For example, if you interact with a person at a company, and that person frequently works with one of their coworkers, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator for that coworker. Collaborators and potential collaborators may see some of your basic information, like your name, Dropbox Business Team name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.\nCertain features let you make additional information available to others.\nOther applications. You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party services\u2013\u2013for example, via Dropbox APIs. By doing so, you\u2019re enabling Dropbox and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Dropbox and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and promote their services. Please remember that third parties\u2019 use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.\nBusiness Team Admins. If you are a user of a Dropbox Business Team, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox Business Team account. Please refer to your organization\u2019s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you aren\u2019t a Dropbox Business Team user but interact with a Dropbox Business Team user (for example, by joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view information about you (such as your name, email address, and profile picture) and your interaction with the Dropbox Business Team user (such as your IP address). If you share Your Stuff with a Dropbox Business Team user, the administrator of the team account may have the ability to access and edit what you share.\nLaw & Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users; (d) protect Dropbox\u2019s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.\nStewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it\u2019s stored on our Services or on your home computer\u2019s hard drive. We\u2019ll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:\n- Be transparent\n- Fight blanket requests\n- Protect all users, and\n- Provide trusted services.\nWe publish a Transparency Report as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.\nHow\nSecurity. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.\nUser Controls. You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your Dropbox account and going to your account settings page. Learn more here about managing your account information generally, or click here to learn how to change your profile information.\nRetention. When you sign up for an account with us, we\u2019ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we\u2019ll initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. Learn more here. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nWhere\nAround the world. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world\u2014including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.\nData Transfers. When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, such as contracts with our customers and affiliates, Standard Contractual Clauses, and the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable.\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. Dropbox complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss\u2013U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Dropbox does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as a legal basis for transfers of personal data. Dropbox has certified to the Department of Commerce that it, and its subsidiary JN Projects Inc. d/b/a HelloSign, adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at https://www.privacyshield.gov.\nDropbox is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance\u2014free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via privacy@dropbox.com. If you aren\u2019t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield. In the event your concern still isn\u2019t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles.\nYour Control and Access of Your Data\nYou have control over your personal data and how it\u2019s collected, used, and shared.

You can also ask us for a copy of personal data you provided to us or that we\u2019ve collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting it, the types of sources we got it from, and types of third parties we\u2019ve shared it with.\n- Object to the processing of your personal data. Depending on the processing activity, you can request that we stop or limit processing of your personal data.\nIf you would like to submit a data access request or object to the processing of your personal data, please email us at privacy@dropbox.com.

April 29, 2021\nReview Previous Policy\nYour privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you use the Garmin Connect website and mobile app, the Garmin Sports website and app, and Garmin wearable devices or other Garmin devices that are compatible with Garmin Connect.\nOther Garmin websites, services, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, we have a separate privacy policy that applies to our Garmin Pay service. Click here to review our other privacy policies.\n\"Personal data\" is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nTo jump to a specific section of this Privacy Policy, please click on a link below:\n- Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin\n- Categories of Recipients of Personal Data\n- International Transfers of Personal Data\n- Cookies and Similar Technologies\n- Application Analytics\n- Children\n- Privacy Policy Updates\n- Retention of Personal Data\n- Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n- Data Controller and Data Protection Officer\n- Your Rights\nCategories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin\nPersonal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:\nWhen you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.\nPURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:\n(a) Garmin processes your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is Garmin\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.\n(b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Garmin website or app or engage with other Garmin users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin\u2019s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin users.\n(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin\u2019s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.\n(d) Garmin also processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.\n(e) Garmin also processes your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.\nPersonal data that is processed when you sign in to your Garmin account with social media credentials if you choose (China only):\nIf you live in China, you may choose to sign in to your Garmin account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your WeChat or QQ sign in credentials). If you choose this method, the first time you sign in, you will be asked whether you agree to the social media provider delivering certain information to Garmin, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments, and other information associated with your social media account.\nAll of this information is made available to Garmin by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information Garmin retains and processes is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with Garmin by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your Garmin account using your Garmin account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.\nPURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:\nGarmin associates the email address provided by the social media provider with your Garmin account so that you can use your email address to sign in to your Garmin account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin\u2019s legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign in method and in securing your account.\nAdditional personal data that is processed if you choose to provide it when you create a Garmin account:\nYou can add additional information to your profile, such as your location, types of activities you participate in (e.g., running, hiking, cycling, golf, etc.), and your gender, birthdate, height and weight.\nPURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUND:\nThis information is used to calculate the calories you burn during an activity and to enable you to show your Connections the types of activities you participate in if you wish. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is your consent. You can withdraw your consent by deleting this information from your account profile.\nPersonal data that is processed when you choose to upload your activities, location and activity data to Garmin:\nYou can choose to upload activities (e.g., runs, walks, bike rides, swims, hikes, gym activities, etc.) and activity data (e.g., steps, distance, pace, activity time, calories burned, heart rate, sleep, location, golf stats, menstrual cycle information, hydration, music played, etc.) from your device to your Garmin account. You can use your device without providing your consent to upload your activities to Garmin.

These third parties may also use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of their and/or our services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies and/or terms and conditions to understand how they use your data and provide services.\nFor some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.\nCOOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES\nWe, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, use cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our services, as explained in more detail below.\nCookies\nCookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:\n- Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don\u2019t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.\n- Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the services and provide you with a better experience.\n- Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don\u2019t receive the same ad each time you access a service.\n- Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our services and other websites and apps.\n- When you use a web browser to access the services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the \"Help\" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note, however, that some services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those services, or certain parts of them. We use the following types of cookies on our website:\nEssential Cookies\nThese enable you to order products and receive services from our website;\nPerformance Cookies\nTheses enable us to analyse the performance and design of our website and detect errors. For example, this type of cookie allows us to recognise that you have visited our website before and shows which sections of our website are most popular by allowing us to see which pages visitors access most frequently and how much time visitors spend on each page. We use, without limitation, Google Analytics, Adobe, and similar analytics cookies to achieve this. For example, the information generated by the cookie about the use of the website will normally be stored on a Google server in the United States. However, if you are located within the EU or the European Economic Area, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand. In exceptional cases only, your full address will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted from your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may prevent web usage data (including your IP address) generated by the cookie from being transmitted to Google and processed there if you download and install this Browser-Plugin (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).\nFunctional Cookies\nwhich allow us to deliver a better user experience. For example, this type of cookie ensures that the information displayed on your next visit to our website will match up with your user preferences, or your Samsung account from which you linked to our website, or the fact that you linked to our website via an email sent to you by Samsung or one of our trusted third party service providers contacting you on our behalf.\nAdvertising Cookies\nwhich enables us and our carefully selected partners to deliver advertisements to you, or contact you directly where you have separately consented to such communications, which match your interests by, for example, collecting information about products you have browsed or ordered on our website. For example, and without limitation, we use Google remarketing tags to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our website. For further information about how Google remarketing tags work, please click here: http://www.google.co.uk/think/products/newremarketing-tag.html. Our website may also display content from a third party website or service, which may result in cookies from third parties being stored on your hard drive or browser. We do not control the storage of these cookies and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third party for more information.\nOther Local Storage\nWe, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as \"Flash cookies\") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.\nBeacons and/or Pixels\nWe, along with certain third parties, may also use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons and pixels can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and pixels, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons and pixels for a variety of purposes, including to analyse the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.\nWhen you access and use our Services (except for websites provided by third party service providers), you will be asked to provide your separate consent to the storage of cookies (which includes other local storage technologies, beacons, pixels and other information on your devices) by us. You will also be asked to provide your separate consent to the access of such cookies (which includes local storage technologies, beacons, pixels and information) by us and by the third parties mentioned above. Your experience of our website/services may be affected if you do not accept cookies, and further information will be provided to you at the time we ask you for this specific consent.\nCONTACT US\nYou can contact us to update your preferences, correct your information, submit a request or ask us questions.\nData Controller\nSamsung Electronics (UK) Limited\nSamsung House, 2000 Hillswood Drive, Chertsey, Surrey KT16 0RS, UK\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\n129, Samsung-ro, Yeongtong-gu,\nSuwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16677, Korea\nIf you have any specific questions, please contact us at:\nEuropean Data Protection Officer\nSamsung Electronics (UK) Limited\nSamsung House, 2000 Hillswood Drive, Chertsey, Surrey KT16 0RS, UK\nYou can also contact us by visiting our Privacy Support Page.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.\n1. What personal information is collected?\nInformation collected from you. If an online visitor submits information to us, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our online platforms, (2) product or account registration, or registration for online game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message boards or forums, (5) eCards or recruit-a-friend e-mails, (6) warranty registrations, (7) online marketing campaign or contest registrations, (8) the playing of a game or use of a service, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical support, (11) Share Wish List feature, and/or (12) newsletters.\nWe will collect account name, BattleTag, name, date of birth, address, country of residency, phone number, e-mail address and password from you. We do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided. We will also collect transaction details to the licensing and purchasing of our products and services. The transaction related information include: name, phone number, address, credit card number, expiration date, email address, bank name, bank account number and/or bank account owner\u2019s name. We need these information to complete all requests you made in connection with the transaction made on Blizzard website.\nFor some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences; and, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.\nFrom time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard\u2019s websites. However, we will obtain the customer\u2019s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.\nInformation Collected Automatically. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to us. We may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community. In addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes. Blizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.\nInformation collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners). Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. If you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account. Similar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.\n2. Why do we process your data and how do we use your personal information?\nThe personal information you provide Blizzard will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or technical support questions or issues; to send eCards or \"Recruit-a-Friend\" emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. Blizzard may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.\nLastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.\nPlease be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.\n3. What type of communications may you receive?\nSpecial Offers and Updates\nWe will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the \"Choice\" section below.\nService-related Announcements\nWe will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. You will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. Game-related Announcements We may send you information related to the game(s) you play. For instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.\nCustomer Service\nBased upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\nIf you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend\u2019s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. In such email, your friend will be provided an opt-out/unsubscribe option. Blizzard does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.\n4. Who is collecting your information?\nWhen you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are sharing that information with Blizzard Entertainment, its parent, and its various affiliates and sister companies, unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy. Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, credit card processing, etc.). If your personal information will be disclosed to a third country, if required by law, you will be specifically provided with that third party information.\nIn addition, some services are provided with partner companies. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information. Please be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.\nPlease be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our websites may collect personal information about you. And remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any advertiser or website you visit.\nOur websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites. These features may collect your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\n5. With whom may your personal information be shared?\nBlizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties. Additionally, we may share your game play data, Battletag, Blizzard ID, and/or unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties for the purpose of tailoring content as well as personalizing, adjusting and improving our services. In addition, we may share your personal information with other Activision Blizzard group companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you. Because of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.\nWe reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law. We may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA). We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.\nAs with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.\nBlizzard websites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below). If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at DPO@blizzard.com to request removal. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\n6. What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\nYou have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information. You can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.\nYour browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning the collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from Blizzard (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at DPO@blizzard.com. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.\n7. What about Children?\nChildren Under 13\nOnce a child states that his/her age is under 13, they will be unable to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children\u2019 personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at DPO@blizzard.com.\nNote to Parents\nWe recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers under the age of 20 and over the age of 13 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/index.html.\n8. What is Real ID?\nReal ID friends can see each other\u2019s real-life name and can see each other\u2019s characters across all Blizzard products and services. By participating in Real ID, you will have the option of making your real name visible to your friend\u2019s friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends. The controls for Real ID are located in Battle.net account management.\nWhen you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you will have access to several additional features, including:\n- Real Names for Friends: Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.\n- Cross-Realm and Cross-Game Chat: With Real ID, friends can chat cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game using Blizzard\u2019s products and services.\n- Rich Presence: You will see additional info on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to in Blizzard\u2019s products and services in real time.\n9. What is Global Play?\nCertain Blizzard games feature \"Global Play,\" which allows you to play with other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your Blizzard account. This feature is very beneficial to players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions. The Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.\n10. What are tracking technologies and how are they used?\nAs is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.\nBlizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users\u2019 movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.\nWe use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users\u2019 settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited.\nWe may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.\nWe, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.\nWe partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\") \u2013 organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA\u2019s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out page. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA\u2019s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\n11. What are Internet Protocol addresses?\nAn Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\"). Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.\n12. What do you do if you want to correct or delete your personal information?\nIf for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact us by e-mailing us at DPO@blizzard.com. We will respond to any request for access within 30 days or within the period as requested by applicable law.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use our information as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce our agreements.\nPlease note that the deletion of your data may lead to the termination of your account and all applicable services.\n13. How secure is my personal information?\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. Blizzard has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In the event that there is a security breach which is likely to be a high risk to impact rights and freedom of the data subject, we will notify such breach and remedial actions to our users/data subjects without delay. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.\nIn addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.\nIt is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent. Choosing a password you don\u2019t use on any other system is important. Changing that password occasionally is also a good idea. Another way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone; just go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.\n- What if you have a question or complaint? If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at DPO@blizzard.com.\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on January 20, 2021.\n"}]}, {"title": "Patreon",

This updated Privacy Policy applies to patrons, creators, and all users of our platform, and is part of our Terms of Use.\nPatreon is a global company. By using our platform, you agree that your personal information that you provide directly to us, or that we collect through your use of the platform, may be transferred to and stored in the United States and handled as described in this Policy.\nInformation You Provide Through Your Account\nThis is information that you provide to us through text fields, such as your name, payment information and benefits. The information we collect differs depending on if you make an account, become a patron, or become a creator.\n- First and Last Name\n- Email Address\n- Username\n- Password\n- State and Country of Residence\nYou may also sign up using a Facebook or Google account. We will ask permission to access basic information from your Facebook or Google account, such as your name, email, and profile picture. You can choose to stop sharing that information with us at any time by going to Facebook or Google to remove Patreon\u2019s access to that account and your ability to log in.\nYou also have the option to add more information to your public profile, such as a location, social media links, and an about section, which we store along with any comments or messages you submit on Patreon.\nPatrons\nA patron is someone who joins Patreon\u2019s membership platform to support a creator\u2019s membership content. As a patron you must provide your payment information to our payment processors. You can see the privacy policy for these payment processors on the PayPal, Stripe, and Checkout sites. At this time, Patreon does not receive your full card number. Payment processors provide us with a token that represents your account, your card\u2019s expiration date, card type and the last four digits of your card number. If you are required to provide your name and email address to the payment processor, then they also provide us with that information.\nWe collect and process information about the creators you support, the level at which you support them, what benefits you receive and how often you support them. As a patron, if you select a benefit tier with a physical benefit, then you will provide your shipping information, including phone number, so the creator or Patreon can ship you the benefit, or provide updates related to the shipment.\nCreators\nA creator is someone who creates and provides content for their patrons through Patreon\u2019s membership platform. To become a creator, you must create a page that describes what you are creating and any benefits you are offering. To receive payouts you have to create an account with one of our payment partners: PayPal, Stripe, or Payoneer. We may also require your bank account information to process payouts. You must also provide us with additional information for tax purposes. Depending on your location you may have to fill out a form with some combination of your:\n- First and Last Name\n- Address\n- Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number\n- Country of Citizenship\n- Foreign Tax Identification Number\n- Date of Birth\n- Your Nonprofit Registration Number, if you are a nonprofit business\n- Bank Account Information for Payouts\n- Phone Number\nAdditional Information We Collect\nAutomatically Collected Information\nWe collect information automatically as you navigate the site or through our third party analytics providers. We may store usage information such as the type of device you use to access Patreon, your operating system, browser type, IP address, and device ID, the pages you visit or request, links clicked, referring sites, user interactions and your search terms. We also derive your location from your self-disclosed country, your IP address, and from your payment card.\nForums and Messaging\nWhen you participate in a forum, we collect the comments you make as well as record how many times users visit, the activity on the site, where users have replied, with whom they\u2019ve communicated, private messages, IP address, and from which location the user was last logged in. We use Discourse and Discord to help us host and operate our Forums. This means that they may access your information to help provide the Forum. You can find their privacy policies hyperlinked above.\nUser Surveys\nFrom time to time, we may solicit your participation in user surveys. We may ask you demographic information, including information related to your gender, ethnicity, race, age, sexual orientation, earnings, and accessibility to better understand and serve our user base which you may elect to share or not. We collect such information to ensure we provide fair and equal access to our services, and to showcase creators to patrons for greater discoverability. To the extent that you participate, we will store your survey responses.\nEvent Information\nAt in-person and online events, we may request information from you. This is done to better tailor the event experience to those in attendance. This information may include your name, email address, payment details, mobile phone number and QR code, demographic information, social media and other online accounts you maintain, details around the types of works you create, and survey or feedback responses.\nBlogs\nWe may collect and store your email address, your comments, and your profile information from our blog sites to better understand your interests and improve our services to you.\nInformation Collected by Third Parties\nCookies\nWe use Cookies on our website that collect information to allow us and third parties to understand your use of Patreon. Please see our cookie policy for more information on our use of cookies on Patreon.\nSocial Media Features and Widgets\nWe use social media features, including the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share button or similar interactive mini-programs that run on Patreon. If you provide your social media information to us, we may use it to interact with you on these social networks. These features may collect your IP address and other personal data including which page you are visiting on our site and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
